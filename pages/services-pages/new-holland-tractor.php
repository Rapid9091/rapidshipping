        <p>
            For any New Holland equipment transportation services locally or throughout the country, call our firm Rapid Auto Shipping. When it comes to shipping your New Holland construction equipment, you can count on Rapid Auto Shipping. New Holland Construction is a construction equipment company based in the United States. New Holland began manufacturing agricultural equipment in 1895 in New Holland, Pennsylvania. The agricultural segment is still the most important part of the business today. Sperry purchased the business in 1947 and ran it for over 27 years.
            <br>
            Between 1974 and 1991, when the firm was purchased by CNH's Fiat subsidiary, New Holland flourished as a Ford division. The company's product line was expanded in 1999 with the acquisition of Germany's Orenstein and Koppel, a well-known construction equipment manufacturer. New Holland Construction was founded in 2005. Currently, the company manufactures 13 different types of construction equipment. Rapid Auto Shipping, the parent company, employs about 60,000 employees worldwide.

        <p>
            Relax, your construction equipment is covered by two insurance policies while it is in transit. First and foremost, each driver we hire is covered by current insurance. We also obtain contingency insurance to cover your equipment while it is being shipped. In case anything goes wrong.

We go above and above to insure your valuables while on the road.

            <p class="services-subtheory-lines-small">
                Allow us to match your construction equipment with the appropriate trailer. Our hauling trailers have cutting-edge technology. We have everything you need, from standard flatbed trailers to multi-axle extended-length carriers. Request that your salesperson describe the relative merits of each trailer option, including step decks, drop decks, and RGNs. Dimensions are irrelevant. We have a lot of experience with big loads! Smaller pieces of New Holland equipment may be eligible to travel as less-than-truckload shipments, saving you money.
