            WHAT IS HEAVY HAUL TRUCKING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Heavy haul trucking is defined as transporting loads or freight that exceed standard-sized regulations. When your cargo is considered big or wide, this method is used. This indicates that the transit freight is wider, longer, heavier, or taller, or a combination of these characteristics. Step deck trailers, RGN trailers, drop deck trailers, and other trailers are commonly used in heavy haul shipping. To avoid any potential dangers or hazards on a regular route, heavy haul trucking cargo requires particular equipment, permits, and the right type of driver.

                HEAVY HAUL TRUCKING DETAILS
            </h2>
            <p>
                Heavy haul trucking goods frequently exceed an 8.6-foot width, a 13.6-foot height, a length of 48 to 53 feet, and a gross weight of over 80,000 pounds.
                For transportation, heavy haul trucking freight must be reduced to its smallest form.
                Flatbed trailers, step deck trailers, double drop trailers, removable gooseneck (RGN) trailers, stretch trailers, and multiple axle trailers can all be utilized for heavy transportation.
                When freight cannot fit on standard-sized trailers, heavy haul trucking transport is used.
                Heavy haul trucking permits and regulations differ by state.
