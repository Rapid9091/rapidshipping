   <h1>Transporting Cars for Dealerships</h1>
   The team at Rapid Auto Shipping is highly skilled in the transportation of cars for dealerships. We offer an auto transport service that specializes in transporting cars for dealerships. Our service is designed to transport your vehicles quickly and at a cost-effective price. We ensure safe and secure transportation of cars through our approved auto transport carriers, which pick up and deliver the vehicles. We offer local and nationwide car dealership transport services that can be easily arranged.
<h2><strong>How Does Car Dealership Transport Operate?</strong></h2>
To arrange the shipment of your new car directly from the dealership, here is the information you need to know:
<h3><strong> Select a car shipping company</strong></h3>
To begin with, you must select a <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/cars" target="_blank"><strong>car shipping</strong></a> company. This step is both challenging and crucial. Ensuring the company you choose to entrust with your new vehicle is professional and trustworthy is essential.
<br><br>
Begin by verifying your potential candidates' registration and insurance coverage with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
<br><br>
Next, it is recommended to read customer reviews on reputable review sites and also check for any complaints that may have been filed with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).
<br><br>
After finalizing the list of companies, you can confidently contact them to request a quote based on your vehicle type and shipment details.
<h3><strong> Choose your preferred shipping method</strong></h3>
Before you can get a complete quote, it is necessary to choose a shipping method from the available options. For vehicle brands such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc., it is recommended to opt for open shipping.
<br><br>
If you own a high-end vehicle such as a Ferrari, Jaguar, Land Rover, Tesla, or any other luxury brand, it is recommended to opt for <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/enclosed-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>enclosed shipping</strong></a>.
<h3><strong> Coordinate between the dealership and the shipping company</strong></h3>
Once you have identified the ideal shipping company in the appropriate location, it is essential to arrange for the pickup of your vehicle in collaboration with both the dealership and the shipping company. Please find a mutually convenient date and time that works for both parties.
<h3><strong> Schedule a drop-off date</strong></h3>
After finalizing all the necessary arrangements, schedule the drop-off date with your chosen shipping company. Keep in mind that the duration of the transportation process may vary depending on the distance of the destination, so plan accordingly.
<br><br>
It should be noted that certain car transport companies, such as Rapid Auto Shipping, provide expedited shipping alternatives that can deliver your vehicle to you quicker.
<h2><strong>What Are the Methods of Delivering Cars to Dealerships?</strong></h2>
We use two methods to transport cars for dealerships.
<h3><strong>Open Transport</strong></h3>
The most common method for dealers to transport cars is through open transport. This is the most cost-effective car shipping method for dealerships and individuals. We offer national <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/door-to-door" target="_blank"><strong>door to door car delivery services</strong></a> through this method.
<h3><strong>Enclosed transport</strong></h3>
Enclosed transport is the safest car shipping method, even for dealers. We transport vehicles in a sealed container that is loaded onto a semi-truck.
<br><br>
Depending on their configuration, these enclosed car transport carriers can hold anywhere from 1 to 6 vehicles. Transporting cars for dealerships using enclosed trucks provides excellent insurance coverage.
<br><br>
If you're looking for superior protection while car dealership auto transport, enclosed trailers are a must-have, especially for dealers.
<br><br>
You can safely ship a wide range of vehicles, including new cars, exotic cars, classic cars, custom vehicles, and any other type of car you need to move. You can impress your customers by ensuring the vehicles sold are transported on enclosed carriers.
<h2><strong>What Is the Cost to Ship A Car From A Dealership?</strong></h2>
Various factors determine the cost of transporting cars for dealerships. The factors determining the cost of shipping a car are the type of vehicle being transported and the distance between the starting point and the destination.
<br><br>
The cost of shipping a car from a dealership varies based on the distance. The average price per mile for distances under 500 miles is $1.50. However, the cost per mile for cross-country shipping is around $0.70.
<br><br>
The price decreases as the number of cars to be delivered decreases, and discounts are available for shipping multiple vehicles.
<br><br>
Our car <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/auto-shipping-calculator" target="_blank"><strong>shipping calculator</strong></a> can provide you with an instant quote. You can contact us either by phone or email to obtain pricing information. For further details, refer to a car's shipping cost.
<h2><strong>What Are the Factors that Affect the Cost of Transporting Cars for Dealerships? </strong></h2>
The <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/car-shipping-cost" target="_blank"><strong>cost of transporting cars</strong></a> for dealerships is determined by several factors, which may include:
<ul>
 	<li>Condition of the vehicle</li>
 	<li>Car make and model</li>
 	<li>The distance of the dealer transport</li>
 	<li>Although multiple cars need to be delivered, discounts are available for shipping various vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Is the Estimated Shipping Time For A Car From A Dealership?</strong></h2>
Typically, it takes 2-5 business days for car dealership auto transport after completing the online paperwork. However, if you need your vehicle shipped more quickly, express car dealership transport is available for an additional fee.
<br><br>
This option allows for pickup within 24-48 hours. After loading the truck, it takes approximately 1-3 calendar days for the shipment to be delivered from pickup to drop-off. On average, a car transport driver covers about 500 miles per day.
<br><br>
Additionally, it's worth noting that most car dealership transport is less than 1,000 miles. We offer dealer car shipping and nationwide auto transport services throughout the United States.
<br><br>
If you're transporting your <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/cross-country-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>vehicle cross-country</strong></a>, please note that it may take longer. We can accommodate your time frame on most weeks of the year with a carrier who can deliver your shipment on time.
