                    <h2><span>Types Of Car Shipping</span></h2>
                    <p> Rapid Auto Shipping provides various transportation car services, from ground transportation via trailer trucks to international cargo boats or aircraft shipments. However, trailer truck transport is the most prevalent mode of car delivery in the United States. Land-based car transport is classified into two types: open transport and enclosed transport.

                    <p>The general procedure for foreign vehicle shipments stays the same but with additional paperwork. Because you'll be sending to a foreign nation with different regulations, you'll usually be required to provide the following documents:
                    </p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At least two versions of government-issued identities, such as a driver's license or passport.</li>

                        <li>The year, make, and type of your car, as well as your vehicle identification number (VIN).</li>
                        <li>Proof of car possession, such as the original title, copies of the title, a bill of sale, or a signed lien permission.</li>
                        <li>Payment information, such as financial or credit card information.</li>

                    <h2><span>Open Air Car Shipping</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        The cheapest choice is open air car shipping, also known as open carrier shipping. This is the same mode of transportation used by car dealerships to send new vehicles, so if you've ever seen a trailer loaded with numerous vehicles on the freeway, you've seen how open auto transports operate.
                            <br><br>
                        The primary advantage of <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/open-car-shipping">open car transport</a> is its cheap cost. Because your vehicle will be sharing a room with other vehicles, the carrier can charge you a reduced price, making it a viable choice for long-distance auto shipping.

                    <h2><span>Enclosed Auto Transport</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/enclosed-shipping">Enclosed auto transport</a> means your vehicle will be shipped in an enclosed trailer, shielded from the weather and possible road detritus. Although you will still be sharing a room with other cars, an enclosed trailer typically only accommodates seven vehicles.
                        <br><br>
                        This choice is significantly more expensive, adding up to $400 to your transportation expenses, but it offers greater peace of mind during the vehicle shipping. In addition, exotic, luxury, or rare cars are more frequently transported in enclosed vehicles.
