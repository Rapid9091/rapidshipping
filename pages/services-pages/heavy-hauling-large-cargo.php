                    Heavy haul trucking is defined as transporting loads or freight that exceed standard-sized regulations. When your cargo is considered big or wide, this method is used. This indicates that the transit freight is wider, longer, heavier, or taller, or a combination of these characteristics. Step deck trailers, RGN trailers, drop deck trailers, and other trailers are commonly used in heavy haul shipping. To avoid any potential dangers or hazards on a regular route, heavy haul trucking cargo requires particular equipment, permits, and the right type of driver.

                                For transportation, heavy haul trucking freight must be reduced to its smallest form.<br>
                                Flatbed trailers, step deck trailers, double drop trailers, removable gooseneck (RGN) trailers, stretch trailers, and multiple axle trailers can all be utilized for heavy transportation.<br>
                                When freight cannot fit on standard-sized trailers, heavy haul trucking transport is used.
                                Heavy haul trucking permits and regulations differ by state.
