        </h2>

The reason for this is that open carriers can accommodate practically any type of vehicle. If you intend to drive your chosen vehicle on a regular basis, Rapid Auto Shipping recommends Open Shipping.

            IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE CAR TRANSPORT IF MY CAR IS FULL OF ITEMS?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Clients and customers frequently inquire if they may leave stuff in their car throughout the Rapid Auto Shipping Car Transport process. No, is the quick response. When you choose a Car Transport Service Company like Rapid Auto Shipping, you will be charged according to the weight of your car or vehicle. During Automobile Transport, it is to your best advantage not to overcrowd your car with personal goods and items. In terms of the legal framework, several states may have extremely specific rules prohibiting you from transporting personal and home things in your vehicle while it is being moved.

            WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OPEN AND ENCLOSED MODES OF TRANSPORTATION?
        </h2>
        <p>

            The involvement of insurance coverage is the most significant distinction between open and closed transportation. During Car Transport, open transport is a shipping method that is often used for cheaper and less expensive autos. Enclosed Car Transport, on the other hand, allows for the transport of up to three cars. Enclosed Transport is another type of climate-controlled car shipping. Rapid Auto Shipping, on the other hand, guarantees that both of these operations will be exceedingly safe, as your automobile shipping safety will always be our main priority.
