                <p class="para-2">
                    When making a decision, the first consideration is usually reputation. Assess the company's dependability based on its price history, license, insurance, expertise, and authority. The company must be officially registered with the government and have current licenses.
                </p>
                <p class="para-2">
                    Aside from that, the firm picked should have positive ratings, particularly online. Check out websites like the Better Company Bureau (BBB) to acquire comments from previous consumers.
                </p>
                <p class="para-2">
                    The BBB is especially trustworthy since it keeps complaints for nearly 36 months and specifies whether or not they were handled by the firm. When shipping internationally, use a domestic company with conveniently accessible offices.

                                There are folks out there who will gladly accept your money and defraud you for the delivery of your Bugatti.

Look for their website on the Internet and study the reviews and ratings posted by previous clients.

                <span>What is the cost of shipping a historic car?</span>
                <i class='bx bx-plus'></i>
            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">When calculating the cost of transporting a vintage automobile, your transport broker will consider the distance and period that is most convenient for you.
                <br><br>
                The average cost to move your automobile 100 miles or fewer is roughly $3.38 per mile, according to Rapid Auto Shipping. Transports of fewer than 1,000 miles cost about $1.14 per mile.
            </p>
            <div class="box">
                <span>Can I transport other items in my vehicle?</span>
                <i class='bx bx-plus'></i>
            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">The great majority of the time, the answer is no. Packing your automobile with extra gear not only adds weight to it, but it also adds another layer of responsibility for the shipper due to the extra "stuff."
            </p>
            <div class="box">
                <span>How Much Time Does It Take To Ship A Car?</span>
                <i class='bx bx-plus'></i>
            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">The time it takes for your car to arrive at its destination, like the cost of shipping, is mostly determined by how far you're sending it. Most firms advertise 8 to 10 company days, although delivery durations vary greatly depending on shipping distance and carrier.
            </p>
            <div class="box">
                <span>Is it preferable to send an automobile in an open or enclosed container?</span>
                <i class='bx bx-plus'></i>
            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">The answer depends on your budget and how much security you believe your car need. Enclosed auto transport provides added protection against road dangers and adverse weather when shipping a vintage automobile, sports car, or any other Bugatti vehicle.  
            </p>
            <div class="box">

                <i class='bx bx-plus'></i>
            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">All of the shippers we looked at would inquire if the car runs or not. You will be charged if it does not operate. It's typically rather little, and all that is required is that the trailer the automobile will be towed on has an electric winch to lift the ramp into place.
            </p>
            <div class="box">
                <span>Where will my car be picked up and dropped off?</span>
                <i class='bx bx-plus'></i>
            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">The car will be picked up and delivered as near to your residence as feasible. Occasionally, due to the maneuverability of these enormous vehicle transport services/carriers or local government requirements, the transporter truck will not be able to arrive straight to your home.
                <br><br>
                In these circumstances, an alternate location with a big parking lot, such as a shopping mall, will be chosen.
            </p>
            <div class="box">
                <span>Will my car be insured?</span>
                <i class='bx bx-plus'></i>
            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">Yes. All of our car transport service providers are insured by state and federal regulations. At pick-up and delivery, the auto shipment driver will thoroughly examine the vehicle.
                <br><br>
                 When your car is delivered, you must examine for any damage that may have occurred during the auto shipment procedure.
                <br><br>
                Make a note of any damage on the Bill of Lading and get the driver's signature. We provide a wide range of services at competitive costs.
