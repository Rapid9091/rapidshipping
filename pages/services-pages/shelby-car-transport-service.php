                                If the vehicle has any modifications or is unusable, you should anticipate other minor costs on your final account. For instance, it might cost $100 more to send a Shelby that isn't functional.

                                Having a precious Shelby shipped off to another place is always nerve-racking. Of course, you want to ensure the vehicle is in excellent shape.

            <p class="para-faq">We have an extensive network of car haulers who can manage open, enclosed, or specialized transport. Enclosed transit is typically reserved for more costly or specialized vehicles, such as show cars, exotics, and expensive luxury vehicles.
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, open transport is the most prevalent type of car transport used for any vehicle that does not need to be protected from the elements.
