            To send your forklift, all you have to do is select Rapid Auto Shipping. A flatbed trailer can accommodate most forklifts, including tiny telehandlers. Height and weight are usually not a problem, but loading can be. To properly load your forklift on a flatbed trailer, you'll need a dock or a larger forklift.

They attach to the back of a truck or trailer, where they don't obstruct cargo space and make transportation a snap. This improves your company's efficiency and safety.

            </h2>
            <p class="services-subtheory-lines-small">
                Forklifts are used to transfer products around building sites, warehouses, and factories, and you've undoubtedly seen them in your local hardware store as well. Shipping with a forklift is simpler than you might imagine. To send your forklift, all you have to do is select Rapid Auto Shipping. A flatbed trailer can accommodate most forklifts, including tiny telehandlers. Height and weight are usually not a problem, but loading can be. To load your equipment into a flatbed trailer safely, you'll need a dock or a larger forklift.
                <br>
                Shipment of larger machinery, such as rough-terrain forklifts, necessitates the use of a step-deck trailer or an RGN trailer. Telehandlers can be large enough to necessitate the use of a step-deck or RGN trailer. You'll drive forward to put your forklift onto a step-deck or RGN trailer from the front of the trailer. You'll have to back the forklift on board if you're using a flatbed. To ship your forklift with Rapid Auto Shipping, give us a call right away!

            HAULING USING A FORKLIFT ON CUSHION TIRES
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because they have a smaller chassis and sit closer to the ground, cushion tyre forklifts are ideal for operating indoors. This improves the manoeuvrability of your forklift. Cushion tyre forklifts may struggle outdoors, but they are ideal for smooth surfaces indoors and have a long life.

            SHIPPING OF ELECTRIC FORKLIFTS
        </h2>
        <p>
            In many aspects, 3-wheel electric forklifts and 4-wheel electric forklifts are identical, but 3-wheel electric forklifts have several unique qualities that make them more suited for specific duties. For example, 3-wheel electric forklifts have a smaller turning radius than four-wheel electric forklifts, making them better suited for tighter locations.

            TRANSPORTING NARROW-AISLE FORKLIFTS
        </h2>
        <p>
            Forklifts with narrow aisles live up to their name. These are commonly utilised in small lane conditions to grab things from higher shelves in warehouses or stores. Narrow-aisle forklifts are fantastic for vertical operations, but they can also be used to transport objects horizontally. This makes this small mover a very desirable piece of machinery. Similarly, when it comes to efficient transportation and shipment, Rapid Auto Shipping lives up to its name.

            TOWING PALLET JACK
        </h2>
        <p>
            Order picker forklifts are appropriate for warehouses with short aisles or limited floor space in general. Some even use wire and double rail guidance systems to reduce rack impact during case pickup and transportation. To maximise safe transport operations, the technology in an order picker forklift allows you to monitor lift height, which then determines the safest speed for that height. Rapid Auto Shipping pledges to ship your order picker forklift with the highest care while transporting your items safely.

            HAULING USING A PNEUMATIC TIRE FORKLIFT
        </h2>
        <p>
            Solid pneumatic tyre forklifts, as opposed to cushion tyres, are meant to haul outside and across difficult terrain. Because these forklift tyres are more similar to car or truck tyres, they can be used on construction sites, outdoor warehouses, and even lumber yards. Pneumatic tyre forklifts are less likely to be punctured by sharp objects during transport because they are constructed of solid rubber.

            FORKLIFT WITH SIDE LOADER TOWING

        <p>
            While you'll generally utilize a narrow-aisle forklift to transfer big products in tight locations, you'll need a side loader forklift to handle long objects. Because it's all about the length of stuff, a side loader forklift's bed is frequently configurable. That means they're ideal for transporting stuff like bar stock, lumber, carpets, bar stocking, tubing, and other similar materials.

            FORKLIFT THAT STANDS UP HAULING
        </h2>
        <p>
            Stand-up forklifts, also known as stand-ons or electric riders, are ideal for operators who must regularly climb on and off the forklift during their many transports. Furthermore, they perform better in narrow aisles than sit-down forklifts, which are frequently wider. Another advantage is that you save time because no seat belt is required, and you don't have to set the parking brake.

        <p>
            Depending on their use, walkie stalkers, also known as pedestrian walk-behind stackers, exist in a range of types. These walk-behind pallet trucks come with a decent-sized mast for raising pallets to various heights and are available in both manual and powered versions. The way each walkie stacker forklift distributes the weight is the key difference. Front legs, straddle legs, or counterbalance weight can all be used.
