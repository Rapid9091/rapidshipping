                            <h2 class="heading-1">International Break <span>Bulk Shipping</span></h2>

                            <p class="para-2">Equipment that must be loaded separately into a cargo plane or ship is referred to as breakbulk, as opposed to equipment and goods that are placed into containers. Most of these services must be contracted individually because of the odd shapes of many breakbulk goods and their tremendous weight. Breakbulk transportation is inconvenient — and costly! Rapid Auto Shipping is the company to call if you need your crop plane, oil rig, or construction crane serviced.
Breakbulk shipping includes cargo in bags, drums, and barrels. Rapid Auto Shipping can load your products onto a suitably rated boat with all necessary safety precautions for a reasonable price. We've transported baled commodities, barrels and casks, liquid-filled drums, palletized things, and even paper reels.</p>

                            <p class="para-2">International container shipping, often known as ocean freight shipping, entails commodities being packed in containers and transported along predetermined routes. Fixed route freight services can assist corporations and other large entities in shipping a significant number of items from one port to another. While this isn't the quickest means to transport goods, it has shown to be dependable and efficient in moving your equipment or consumer items from one port to the next.
Your equipment is loaded and sealed into shipping containers before being delivered to its final destination in transport-ready containers that can be transported by rail or vehicle overland. Customer freight shipments overseas can be avoided by using Rapid Auto Shipping to help move smaller items in container shipments.</p>

Transport charges, customs taxes, and any paperwork required to get your equipment from one port to another are all included in Rapid Auto Shipping' service. Our logistics experts maintain track of the weather and provide you with real-time updates so that your overland transport services are ready when your equipment arrives in port.
