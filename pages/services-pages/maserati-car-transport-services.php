                    When a car shipping service claims to use open-air trucks, it employs the car carrier that most
                    people associate with moving cars. A typical example of this kind of vehicle is between 75 and 80
                    feet long and used to tow a two-level trailer with a long row of cars on top and a shorter row at
                    the bottom. The vehicles on the trailer are constantly open to the weather because it has no sides
                    or a roof.

                                For customized or non-operational cars, additional costs might apply. For
                                non-operational cars, there is a fee of about $100.
