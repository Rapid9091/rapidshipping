            What Are the Benefits of Shipping My Motorcycle?

        </h2>
        <p>

            Whether on weekend countryside excursions, twisty highways, or long cross-country rides to Bike Weeks, motorcycle owners like riding.

            When a rider is on the go, though, riding isn't always the ideal option. Other vehicles, possibly loaded with your things, may need to be driven. The owners may need to be in the moving trucks. Perhaps you're moving in the cold and don't want your hands to freeze to the handlebars. If you're traveling thousands of miles, you might not want to stop for gas every 100 miles.<br>

            Even seasoned riders in their latter years use Rapid Auto Shipping to ship their bike to Daytona Bike Week or the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally! Because not everyone can tolerate hundreds or thousands of miles in the saddle, we frequently assist owners in shipping their motorcycles to drop-off places just outside of the areas so that they can pick them up and ride into town.

            There are a number of reasons why you should transport your motorcycle. It's just a simple technique to travel hundreds or thousands of kilometres without risking damage to your bike. However, entrusting the process to an experienced motorbike transport company like Rapid Auto is the best option for you!

            How Do Motorcycles Get Shipped?

        </h2>
        <p>
            On the surface, transporting a motorcycle is similar to transporting a regular-sized vehicle. You figure out what services you'll need, how much they'll cost, and then look for a company that can do the job.

            However, the processes diverge after that. A regular open auto transportation truck is typically utilized for shipping a conventional automobile, truck, or SUV. However, that type of carrier is not accessible for shipping a motorcycle. Motorcycles do not have four wheels, while open transport trucks are designed to haul cars with four wheels. As a result, they won't be able to seat safely on an open transport truck, necessitating the employment of alternative ways.<br>

            The most typical method of transporting a motorcycle is on an enclosed carrier once it has been created. A flatbed truck, fastened to the bed and exposed to the elements, is another possibility.

            Creating a motorcycle is usually as cheap as, if not cheaper than, shipping it on a flatbed truck. The majority of motorcycle-only shippers use enclosed vehicles specifically built to transport motorcycles. As a result, their costs reflect this. Flatbed transporters are less prevalent and aren't typically utilized to move smaller vehicles such as motorcycles. You can consult with our agent to determine which method is best for your shipping.

            Having said that, finding a low-cost motorcycle transport provider is not difficult. More crucially, due to its lighter weight, transporting a motorcycle is usually less expensive than shipping a car.

            MOTORCYCLE SHIPPING USING ENCLOSED AUTO TRANSPORT
        </h2>
        <p>
            An enclosed motorcycle transport carrier is the safest way to transport your motorcycle. The sturdy sides protect the details, leather seats, and body of your bike from damage or breakage caused by the elements. Your motorbike will be shipped and delivered safely to your destination on time for key bike rallies and events, crated in an enclosed motorcycle transport carrier, secured to a custom pallet, and appropriately isolated from other bikes.

            For motorbike transportation via enclosed transport, for example, we provide two options:

            First, the heavy canvas covering the carrier protects your motorcycle from wind-blown debris, rain, sleet, snow, and other factors.

            Hard-Sided Enclosed Motorcycle Transport — Finally, hard-sided carriers protect your motorcycle in the unlikely case that it is damaged while being transported.

            Getting the Motorcycle Ready for Transportation
        </h2>
        <p>

            Getting your bike ready for transportation is similar to getting any other vehicle ready for transit. When it is shipped, you should only have a quarter tank of gas. Also, make sure the motorcycle is running, and if it isn't, inform your representative. You should look for any loose connections, especially with the wheels and handlebars. It's a rare occurrence, but we've seen clients' bikes fall apart when loading or unloading!

            Make sure you understand the mode of transportation you're committing to. If you're having your motorcycle crated, make sure it's at a convenient location where a crate can be erected. There should also be ample space for the truck. If you are unable to do so, speak with an agent about other pickup locations.
            <br>
            The procedure will be the same as when transporting an automobile when the carrier comes. You'll need to evaluate the motorcycle and record any existing damage before signing the Bill of Lading with your driver as verification of the examination. The majority of drivers will not require assistance in putting together the crate in which the motorcycle will be carried. You should, however, be prepared to aid if necessary.

            Get the most benefit of your shipment
        </h2>
        <p>
            Before you schedule a shipping, make sure to check rates and services. Motorcycles are more challenging to price for shippers, especially if they are not a motorcycle-only business. As a result, comparing prices is critical.

            You should definitely discuss additional options with your agent to make the cargo easier for them, the carrier, and yourself. Don't be hesitant to phone a few different companies and ask the same questions; you might get various replies.<br>

            Before placing your order, always read the reviews of any potential shipper. The majority of organisations you'll discover online nowadays are highly rated, with low-ranked businesses either disappearing or being buried in search results. This is helpful, but you should always double-check a shipper's authority and accountability.

            When you know you'll need to ship your motorcycle, you should start looking as soon as possible. Inquire if crating a motorcycle is an additional expense — it shouldn't, but not all carriers include crating in their pricing. Dotting your "I's" and crossing your "T's" can help you get the most out of your cargo.

            What Influences Our Motorcycle Shipping Costs?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Distance - In general, the longer the distance, the more expensive it is to ship a motorcycle. There are, however, some notable exceptions. Because your bike is travelling in a fully loaded carrier, if we ship it to a destination along a busy shipping route, such as a city along Interstate 95 between New York and Florida, you may experience shockingly reduced shipping charges. Putting a half loaded truck on the road is more expensive for both our clients and us.

            Off the Beaten Path - If your destination is not on a major interstate route, you can expect to pay more for motorbike transportation. There are additional costs associated with exiting the freeway and travelling to an out-of-the-way location.<br>

            Style of Bike - Some motorcycles have distinctive frames that make it impossible to simply strap them to our motorcycle transport services carrier. Instead, they must be installed and supported on specialised cradles to prevent scratches and damage.

            Weight of Bike — In order to provide you with an exact price, we also need to know the weight of your bike. We've heard reports about motorbike carriers providing you an estimate without considering the bike's weight, then notifying you when you arrive to pick it up that the motorcycle transport fee is higher than you expected.

            How long will it take for my motorcycle to be shipped?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The time it takes to move a motorcycle, like any other vehicle, is determined by a number of factors. The most important factor is distance, although additional factors can include:

            Time of Year: Some periods of the year are busier than others, and availability may be limited, notably during rallies and events. This implies you'll have to plan ahead of time and potentially add more time to your transportation itinerary than you had anticipated.<br>

            Weather: Our drivers understand that the safety of your motorcycle is paramount in shipping and will go to great lengths to ensure that it is protected. This may entail slowing down, detouring, or even stopping the vehicle to allow bad weather to pass. Transporting a motorcycle to places where bad weather is more usual, particularly during seasons when snow and ice are a concern, can take longer.
            <br>
            Ease of Access: Just like any other form of transportation, getting a motorcycle to a remote location will take longer than getting to a terminal, city, or major route. Even if it's only a few miles from the nearest simple drop point, back roads and narrow country lanes can add a day or more to the journey. We'll work with you at Rapid Auto Shipping to find a solution that is both timely and convenient.
