                                Lowboy trailers are used to transport huge machinery such as bulldozers, backhoes, and dump trucks that aren't road rated despite having wheels. They're built with two drops on the trailer, allowing taller, non-disassembled equipment to ship through low-clearance zones. Freight height requirements are typically 8', which many larger machines may surpass if transported on a different type of trailer. The maximum weight for a two-axle lowboy trailer is 40,000 pounds, however, depending on the number of axles necessary, the weight restriction can be increased to 80,000 pounds total weight and load. We have everything you need to transfer equipment on a lowboy trailer at Rapid Auto Shipping.

When this happens, the length of a standard lowboy trucking can increase from 28 to 50 feet. There are extension stops every 24 inches as well. This makes it possible to transport longer, heavier equipment in a safe manner.

                                We must first establish the sort of haul you require in order to move a lowboy trailer. There are power-only options for shipping the lowboy trailer on its own, or it can be carried on a separate trailer for travel. Lowboy trailers come in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate a wide range of transport applications. Each model of lowboy has its own set of features that cater to a specific demand for transporting varied heavy loads. The fixed gooseneck, or FGN, has a longer deck length and is the lightest of the three options. Although the decreased weight is advantageous, the fixed neck eliminates the ability to detach and load over the trailer's front.
                                <br><br>

                                The MFGN, or mechanical folding gooseneck, has a deck that folds down to the ground, creating a ramp for simpler trailer loading. When transporting a lowboy trailer, the structural differences between these and other types provide their own set of issues. You should use professionals who are familiar with the challenges that arise while towing a lowboy trailer, so you can be assured that your investment is being properly prepared, loaded, and sent. With Rapid Auto Shipping, a professional logistics agent will gather all of the required information to deliver the type of lowboy transportation you require.
                                We also rovide lowbed trucking.
