            THREE WAYS TO SHIP A BOAT OVERSEAS
        </h2>
        <p>
            Lift on Lift off (LoLo), Roll on Roll off (RoRo), and Semi-Submersible are the three basic methods for shipping a boat or yacht abroad.
            <br>
            Roll on Roll off (RORO) shipping is the most popular service option for customers who have boats on trailers. When ships ship by RORO, the boats simply roll onto the ship's deck and off at their final destination.
            <br>
            Boats on cradles can also be sent this manner, but the cradle is placed on a moving flat rack provided by the shipping line, which is used to maneuver the unit onto the vessel and off at the ultimate destination.
            <br>
            The standard height restriction for RORO service is 15 feet, but this varies with every line.
            <br>
            Lift on Lift off Boat Shipping: Some boats are too large for RORO and must be crane-lifted onto the ship's deck, where they are blocked and lashed in place.
            <br>
            This service has no height restrictions because they are stored on the liner's upper deck for the duration of the voyage. There are additional crane fees at both the origin and destination for this service.
            <br>
            Using A Semi-submersible Vessel, Transfer Water From One Body To Another:
            <br>
            There are specifically built semi-submersible vessels for larger super boats that can literally take these boats out of the water and deposit them back into the ocean at their destination.
            <br>
            The carrier vessel lowers its deck below the waterline, and the boats take up positions above it. The boats are secured in place by divers, and the vessel rises from the sea once they are all in place. This is a fascinating process to observe.
