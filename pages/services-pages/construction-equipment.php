            CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT TRANSPORT SERVICE
        </h2>
        <p>
            Rapid Auto Shipping provides dependable, timely, and safe heavy equipment moving for a variety of construction applications across North America. We provide door-to-door transportation for practically all types of construction equipment across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Rapid Auto Shipping works with over 11,000 professional carriers who have demonstrated expertise, premium insurance coverage, and excellent Department of Transportation safety records. These companies operate the most sophisticated fleets of specialized heavy equipment moving in the business, including:
            <br><br>
            Flatbeds

            Due to size or dimensions, freight cannot be transported in an enclosed vehicle.
            Allow for loading and unloading from the top, back, and sides, either manually or with a crane.
            Ideal for deliveries that must be made quickly or where there are no loading docks.
            Decks with steps
            The deck has been lowered to accept cargo that is taller than 8'6" and the maximum cargo height has been increased by 20 inches to 10'2".
            For baggage that is excessively tall
            Deck clearance is reduced.
            Allows for up to 11'6" RGN freight (removable goosenecks) allowing freight to be pushed on and rolled off
            For various types of equipment, Rapid Auto Shipping's team uses customized trailers:
            Perimeter beam frame with multiple axles
            Trailers with two lanes
            Self-propelled modular transport with dolly systems (SPMT)

            This is only a sample of the types of construction equipment we can transport. If your construction equipment is not listed above, please do not hesitate to contact Rapid Auto Shipping. It's critical to have the following information on hand when calling to inquire about construction equipment services:
            The amount of construction equipment you'll have to move.
            Each item of construction equipment that needs to be sent should be identified by its name, make, and model.
            Height, width, length, and weight are the dimensions for each vehicle.
            You will be picked up and dropped off at different sites.
            A rough estimate of how long it will take to get from point A to point B.

            Our competent and experienced drivers are completely bonded, licenced, and insured and can move construction equipment using a variety of trailers. For moving construction equipment, we have the following trailers available:
            <br>
            <br> Flatbed Carriers
            <br> Removable Gooseneck Carriers
            <br> Double Drop Carriers

            <br> Extendable Carriers<br>
            <br>
            Our logistic professionals can identify what insurance, permits, and tolls are required for your construction equipment hauling once the route has been determined. It's critical to recognise that we'll need both state and federal permissions, as well as the fact that some jurisdictions require additional insurance when shipping construction equipment out of state. Despite the fact that we have a highly skilled staff of professional drivers and a large fleet of trailers, there are some construction shipping jobs that we are unable to complete. In these cases, we can provide you with a list of construction hauling providers that can meet your shipping requirements.

Some equipment may only require a ramp to drive up. Based on the type of construction equipment, the size, and the weight, a Rapid Auto Shipping team member will be able to tell you what works best. Escorts and pilot cars may be required when transporting construction machinery, which we can provide for you.
