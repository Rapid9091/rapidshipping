            LINE HAUL TRANSPORTATION?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The moving of commodities and objects, or freight, between two sites via truck, rail, airplane, or ship is referred to as transportation. Because freight varies in size, weight, and volume, the logistics for transporting freight may vary as well. For example, if you wanted to convey a 10,000kg object across the ocean to the United States, the logistics would be more expensive and time consuming than sending a smaller piece domestically.
            <br>
            Line haul transport and LineHaul logistics assists businesses in determining the logistics for transporting items between certain locations within a set timeframe.

            WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LINE HAUL CARRIER TRACKING?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Carriers often track the logistics of each delivery using digital software in order to create reliable analytics of the line haul operation. Carriers guarantee that they are satisfying client requests and complying with government standards by doing so. Line haul carrier tracking also enables carriers to assess their hauling procedures in order to improve efficiency and optimise their operations. For example, a carrier might compare the journey periods of a cargo ship sailing around the coast with a truck driving along the coastal highway to see which is the most cost-effective option for the next delivery.
            <br>
            These insights help carriers save money, deliver vital information to customers, and verify their compliance with government agencies.

            WHAT AREAS ARE AFFECTED BY A LINE HAUL CARRIER?
        </h2>
        <p>

            Line haul carries have a number of effects on the transportation process. The hauling process can become less expensive, more punctual, and help boost client faith in the carrier depending on the carrier's efficiency. Impact of line haul carriers:
            <br>
            Delivery time: The delivery time is mostly determined by the carrier's efficiency and tracking. For example, if carriers advise the recipient of the projected arrival time, they will be ready to begin unloading when the freight arrives.
            <br>
            Transportation costs: Because carriers track analytics for each delivery, they have an impact on freight transportation costs. This assists them in determining the correct cost for moving freight while yet allowing the organisation to make a profit.

            <br> Line haul carriers have a direct impact on freight flow because they control the modes of transportation. For example, a line haul carrier with a large cargo ship fleet may be able to control the bulk of freight shipping over a body of water, lowering costs and eliminating competition.

            <br> Line haul carriers ship to and from depots, allowing them to have more control over ship timings. Depots allow finished goods or raw materials to be safely stored while awaiting delivery in a controlled environment.

            <br> Shipping to and from sorting facilities: Line haul carriers transport raw materials and goods to and from sorting facilities, where corporations separate them into categories for specialised purposes. A retail corporation, for example, might sort thousands of specific retail items at a sorting facility before shipping them to stores or storage depots for later use.

            BENEFITS OF LINEHAUL TRANSPORTATION
        </h2>
        <p>
            Companies that use line haul transportation have a more efficient freight transportation model than those who use traditional models such as long haul trucking. For freight carriers, here are some important benefits of line haul transportation:
            <br>
            <br><b>Improved delivery times</b><br>

            A line haul carrier can typically transport freight more quickly than traditional freight models. Carriers keep track of each delivery's logistics, allowing them to constantly improve the freight shipping process to improve delivery speed and quality. For example, if a freight carrier tracks its average delivery speed, it may determine which roads or locations slow down vehicles and suggest an alternate route for its drivers to save time and money on delivery.
            <br>
            <br><b>Improved customer interactions</b><br>

            Freight movement may be significantly more efficient, less expensive, and timely using line-haul transportation. This can help to improve customer and freight carrier relationships, resulting in a more efficient supply chain. Freight carriers can charge lower rates for each delivery and can better guarantee the quality of each shipment. Customers may value greater honesty, lower costs, and faster delivery of goods and raw materials required for daily operations.
            <br>
            <br><b>Cost savings</b><br>

            Carriers can track statistics for freight movement via line-haul carrier tracking. These analytics provide useful information on the shipment process, allowing the carrier to cut down on transportation expenses. These savings can be passed on to the client in the form of lower delivery fees. For example, if a carrier monitors the performance of truck tires and determines that Tire A is more fuel-efficient than Tire B, each vehicle's tires can be replaced for a more fuel-efficient fleet, saving money on maintenance expenditures.
            <br>
            <br><b>Communication between carriers and providers should be improved.</b><br>

            Linehaul transportation uses analytics to connect the supply chain, allowing for greater communication between the carrier, product providers, customers, and other parties engaged in the shipping process. Companies can eliminate errors, improve their understanding of the shipping process, and deliver more value with better communication and accuracy. This level of communication strengthens the supply chain and helps everyone save money.

            Truck drivers in line haul trucking operate in shifts to reduce weariness. This has a number of implications for the freight transportation operation as well as the drivers. A normal shift for a driver is from eight or nine o'clock in the morning until approximately five or six o'clock in the evening. This reduces worker tiredness, which can lead to more mistakes and workplace accidents. Allowing drivers to take breaks between shifts can make transportation safer, more efficient, and less expensive.

            LONG HAUL VS. LINE HAUL TRUCKING: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Linehaul transportation comprises line haul trucking, a more efficient way of transporting big numbers of commodities across long distances. Linehaul trucking is distinct from long haul trucking, which is another frequent trucking mode.
            <br>
            Long haul truckers typically spend days, weeks, or even months driving to and from their destinations, whereas line haul truckers operate in shifts. This aids the carrier in reducing worker tiredness, which could lead to an accident. It also aids the carrier in lowering the costs of long travels, such as gasoline, meals, and accommodation expenses for long-haul drivers.

            CHARGE FOR LINE HAUL
        </h2>
        <p>
            A "line haul transportation charge" is a fee that carriers often charge for shipping services. The overall distance between the pickup and delivery locations, as well as the weight of the freight, are usually used to calculate this charge. The linehaul price solely covers these expenses, not loading, unloading, or transfer fees. If these supplementary services are required, the consumer usually pays for them.
