However, there are more secure ways to ship a vehicle than open shipping. Enclosed car carriers are far more secure than exposed car movers.

It's simple: enclosed car movers give their vehicles the most security and safety against the weather. Enclosed auto transport costs approximately 60% more than open car transport, but it safeguards cars much better and is highly suggested for prestige or antique vehicles. While it is not the cheapest car shipping way of moving vehicles, it is far more secure.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para-faq">Yes, you can; we transport several broken down cars. However, inoperable cars and vehicles typically take longer to gather up and cost more because not all truckers can or are willing to carry them.
            </p>

            <p class="para-faq">In most cases, you can store up to 100 pounds of personal items in the trunk or storage section of your vehicle, truck, or SUV. Otherwise, your car must be vacant.

            <p class="para-faq">The price is heavily influenced by the distance you ship your car. However, if you are shipping your car from or to a remote location, you may be assessed extra fees.
                <br><br>
                For example, auto carriers may charge an additional price to drive your vehicle to a less populated area because it takes more time and is typically much farther away from the carrier's following location.

            <p class="para-faq">According to our research, it is always more cost-effective to ship your vehicle rather than buy a new one. However, before settling on this decision, you’ll want to take stock of how much it will cost to sell your vehicle, ship it, and buy a new one.
