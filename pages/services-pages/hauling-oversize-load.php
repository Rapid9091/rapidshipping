            HAULING OVERSIZE LOAD ?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Any freight or cargo that exceeds the maximum permissible width, height, or length is considered oversize or overweight. This may differ from one state to the next, or even from one country to the next. Based on the origin and destination, Rapid Auto Shipping can assist in determining what will be termed an oversize load. The following are some common oversize load details to consider when transporting freight:
            <br>
            In general, the maximum allowable load for combined height and width is 8.5 feet. Oversize loads are defined as those that exceed this limit.
            <br>
            For safe oversize load transport, most oversize cargo exceeding 12 feet requires an escort or pilot car.
            <br>
            To ensure that big freight is transported properly, special licenses are required.
            <br>
            The amount of time that large loads are allowed to travel varies by state. Some states, for example, prohibit the carriage of oversize loads on holidays and weekends. Others only allow transportation at specific times of the day.
            <br>
            The cost of shipping an oversize load varies depending on the cargo, the permissions required, and the transportation routes planned.
            <br>
            The logistics team at Rapid Auto Shipping will do everything possible to give you the most reasonable oversize load shipping quote.

            USING THE RIGHT TRUCKS AND TRAILERS TO TRANSPORT OVERSIZE LOADS TRUCK
        </h2>
        <p>
            An aircraft fuselage, a spool of cable, or a multi-ton excavator are all examples of enormous loads. They've all been relocated by Rapid Auto Shipping. These cargoes can have a wide range of compositions, but they always have one thing in common: their sheer size makes them dangerous to transport. That is why having the appropriate trucks and trailers for big loads is critical. Rapid Auto Shipping' first focus is the safety of the team and your equipment.
            <br><br>
            Different permits and specially certified trailers and rigs are required for oversize and overweight cargoes. We estimate the finest shipping alternatives by calculating the dimensions and weights of your machinery transport. Escort vehicles, as well as oversize load banners on trucks, are designed for safety and are required in many locations. This is to protect the team and people around them from any road hazards. For conveying cargo loads that surpass ordinary standards, there are a variety of trailer choices. When dealing with equipment of this size and scale, most oversize and overweight transports require RGNs or extended RGNs to overcome height and weight concerns. Rapid Auto Shipping will arrange the appropriate type for you, guaranteeing that your costly machinery reaches on schedule and is ready to work.
