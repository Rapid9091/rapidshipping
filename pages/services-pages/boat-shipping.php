                                To prevent hatches and latches from opening during transit, they should be properly fastened and taped shut.
                                All of the cabin's belongings should be packed. All valuables should be taken out of the room.
                                The cords should be tied off and the batteries should be disconnected. Battery-operated engine hatch covers should be fastened to prevent them from opening during transport.<br><br>
                                It is not possible to transfer a dinghy on its davits. It should be secured and padded in the cockpit or stored in the cabin.
                                Any unsecured things in the cabin or on the deck should be removed or properly secured.
                                If you're moving a sailboat with a centerboard, make sure it's securely fastened so the board stays in the "up" position.

                            <p class="para-2">
                                One of the leading causes for needing to ship a boat is moving residences or relocating. There are numerous extra steps to ship a boat overseas, but the most popular solutions for shipping a boat overseas are port-to-port ones. Rapid Auto Shipping is the industry-leading <b>boat shipping company</b>. When shipping your boat overseas, size and weight are the two main determinants of shipping a boat abroad costs. There is no surprise that heavier cargo costs more to transport than lighter freight, and boats are no different from other vehicles in this regard. Size becomes an issue when a boat needs special handling because of its size or other factors that make it difficult to ship and load conventionally. Winterizing your boat before sending it abroad is highly advised.
