            Knowledge on Boat Shipping in General

        </h2>
        <p>
            To prevent hatches and latches from opening during transit, they should be properly fastened and taped shut.
            All of the cabin's belongings should be packed. All valuables should be taken out of the room.
            The cords should be tied off and the batteries should be disconnected. Battery-operated engine hatch covers should be fastened to prevent them from opening during transport.
            It is not possible to transfer a dinghy on its davits. It should be secured and padded in the cockpit or stored in the cabin.
            Any unsecured things in the cabin or on the deck should be removed or properly secured.
            If you're moving a sailboat with a centerboard, make sure it's securely fastened so the board stays in the "up" position.
