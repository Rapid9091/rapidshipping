   <h1>Car Transport Service</h1>
   Do you require a car transport service? We can transport your vehicle to your new home, whether it's a second car for your family, a precious vintage automobile, or a speedboat. We offer an open car transport service, similar to auto manufacturers' methods of transporting new cars to dealerships. We also provide an enclosed car transport service to protect your vehicle from external elements.
<h2><strong>How Does A Car Transport Service Work?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Get Your Quote</strong></h3>
Our free vehicle shipping tool makes it easy to determine how much it will cost to move your car.
<h3><strong>Choose your service and the date</strong></h3>
Choose a date and the service you want. We have Standard, Express, and Enclosed <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/door-to-door" target="_blank"><strong>door to door car moving services</strong></a>.
<h3><strong>A vehicle is moved</strong></h3>
After placing your order, you'll be matched with a car carrier, and your car will be moved.
<h2><strong>Type of Car Transport Service</strong></h2>
Selecting a car transport service that aligns with your specific requirements is essential. A range of car transport services is available, which can vary depending on your chosen provider.
<h3><strong>Open Car Transport Service</strong></h3>
You have likely seen the auto transport trucks on the highway. These trucks have big open trailers that can accommodate up to eight vehicles.
<br><br>
However, several other types of auto transport are available besides that one. You have the option to select the enclosed trailer for transporting your vehicle.
<br><br>
This is an ideal solution for safeguarding rare cars you prefer to keep sheltered from the elements. The enclosed transportation method is also excellent for transporting recreational vehicles and motorcycles.
<br><br>
While enclosed auto transport may come at a slightly higher cost, the added protection it provides for your car is worth the price, especially when it arrives safely at its destination.
<h3><strong>Enclosed Car Transport Service</strong></h3>
If you own an exotic or <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/classic-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>classic car</strong></a>, choosing a closed-car transport service option is advisable as it provides excellent safety for your vehicle. Closed car transports are commonly used to transport high-end vehicles such as super and race cars.
<h3><strong>Truck or Trailer (Most Common)</strong></h3>
The most popular way to transport a vehicle over land is through truck or trailer transportation, which is preferred due to its affordability and ease of use. There are two primary methods.
<h3><strong>Freight train</strong></h3>
Transporting a single vehicle on a freight train is feasible but can be prohibitively expensive if only one car is being moved. If you are responsible for relocating a fleet of vehicles, shipping them by train can be a viable alternative.
<h3><strong>Ocean Freight</strong></h3>
Transporting your car overseas or along a coastline is viable for individual vehicles and fleets. The cost of this service is comparable to that of trailer hauling.
<h3><strong>Airplane</strong></h3>
Although it is possible to transport a car by air freight, it is not a common practice due to the exorbitant expenses involved.
<br><br>
Transporting a vehicle via airplane is usually limited to exceptional situations, and the cost can surpass the worth of the transported automobile.
<h2><strong>What Is the Cost of A Car Transport Service?</strong></h2>
The current market rates and the latest fuel prices for nationwide auto transport determine the prices offered by the car transport service. The total cost of <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/best-autoshipping-company-usa" target="_blank"><strong>auto shipping</strong></a> or car transport service will vary based on several factors.
    <br><br>
These include the type of car you want to move, its current operational condition, any modifications it may have, the destination you need it to be transported to, and whether you choose an open or enclosed car hauling trailer.
<h3><strong>A car's dimensions and weight</strong></h3>
The transportation rate for a vehicle increases slightly if it is longer, taller, or heavier. This is because transport trucks have limited space and must adhere to weight regulations.
<h3><strong>Condition of running vehicles</strong></h3>
Transporting non-operational vehicles typically incurs higher costs due to the need for extra equipment and labor to load and unload them. Additionally, it can pose difficulties in delivering other vehicles. We can ship your car if it can roll, steer, and brake.
<h3><strong>Type of carrier</strong></h3>
The most affordable option for door-to-door transportation is open car shippers, which are also the standard units used for this purpose. Enclosed vehicle shippers are considered the safest mode of transportation for vehicles.
<br><br>
These transport units feature containers that house the cars inside the truck. Although they may cost slightly more, the added security is worth the investment.
<h3><strong>Transportation distance</strong></h3>
Although longer runs may have a higher overall price, they tend to have a <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/low-cost-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>lower cost</strong></a> per mile. The longer the distance your vehicle travels, the greater the savings you can achieve on an auto transporter.
<h3><strong>Pickup and drop-off location</strong></h3>
Please provide information regarding where the car will be picked up and its destination. Suppose your pickup or delivery location is in a major urban center with easily accessible routes. In that case, you will be charged a lower fee than in a rural area that is hard to reach.
<h3><strong>Time of year</strong></h3>
The cost of a<a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/car-shipping-services"  target="_blank"><strong> car shipping service</strong></a> may vary depending on the season you choose. The overall cost may be higher during certain seasons. This holds particularly true in winter when road conditions are more challenging and hazardous.
<h2><strong>What Is the Estimated Shipping Time for My Car?</strong></h2>
The duration required to relocate your car to its new destination depends on the distance that must be covered. On average, it takes 3-7 business days for a vehicle to be shipped from pickup to delivery.
<br><br>
Your moving consultant will provide you with an automobile quote that includes detailed information about the exact timing of both the loading and delivery. Rapid Auto Shipping offers numerous benefits, including ensuring fixed vehicle pickup and delivery dates.

<h2><strong>What Are the Distinctions Between Open And Enclosed S</strong><strong>hipping?</strong></h2>
"Open shipping" refers to the transportation of a vehicle on a trailer that is not covered or protected and is pulled behind a truck. We have all experienced being on the highway, following one of those massive open auto transport trucks.
<br><br>
This shipping method is ideal for transporting affordable cars or for those that require fast and cost-effective transportation.
<br><br>
They are highly effective in inducing tension and anxiety among other drivers on the interstate. Enclosed shipping refers to the transportation of goods using a truck or trailer that is covered.
<br><br>
Although it may be pricier than open shipping, <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/enclosed-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>enclosed shipping</strong></a> provides superior vehicle protection, making it the ideal choice for rare or collector cars.
<h2><strong>What Is the Most Cost-effective Method for Transporting A Vehicle?</strong></h2>
Open transport is the most cost-effective method of transporting a car. Depending on the vehicle and company, you may save hundreds of dollars on open truck transport.
<br><br>
This shipping method is suitable if you only need to transport a car from one location to another. However, it may not be the most appropriate option for valuable, rare, or collectible vehicles that require extra protection.

<br><br>
<strong>FAQS</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>How can I prepare my vehicle?</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Keys:</strong>
<br><br>
To proceed, you must provide the chosen carrier with the keys to the ignition, trunk, gas cap, and any other locked compartment. Please make copies of your keys and leave only those copies.
<br><br>
Ensure you keep your original set of keys after checking them. This aims to ensure the documents are compatible with all devices and compartments.
<br><br>
<strong>Don’t Fill Your Gas Tank:</strong>
<br><br>
We recommend keeping your gas tank below a quarter of its capacity due to weight regulations set by the Department of Transportation (DOT).
<br><br>
<strong>Avoid over-packing:</strong>
<br><br>
Lightweight and delicate personal belongings. Only luggage or small boxes weighing 100 lbs can be shipped inside the trunk.
<br><br>
The infant car seat and a spare tire with a jack are essential components of the vehicle and may be included. You may be asked to provide additional compensation if your car is overpacked.
<br><br>
You may also be required to remove anything not permanently mounted or bolted to the vehicle. Nothing obstructs the view out of the windows. This is a mandatory requirement that ensures the safety of our crew.
<br><br>
Our crew frequently needs to load these vehicles onto the trailer with the mirrors folded in, utilizing only the windows. If the view is obstructed, there is a higher potential for damage and injury.
<br><br>
<strong>Don’t Pack Firearms or Fire Extinguishers</strong>
<br><br>
Transporting firearms, ammunition, or fire extinguishers in a vehicle is prohibited.
<br><br>
<strong>Alarm Systems:</strong>
<br><br>
If there is an alarm system, it needs to be deactivated. Either the alarm remote must be provided before dropping off or handed over during the drop-off process.
<br><br>
<strong>Disabled / Inoperable Vehicles:</strong>
<br><br>
If your vehicle is not functioning correctly, it should be placed securely. Furthermore, it should have easily accessible inflated tires, fully functional brakes, and steering.
<br><br>
<strong>Oversized / Modified Vehicles:</strong>
<br><br>
Unless previously noted to our dispatch department, factory stock vehicles must be at most a certain height or clearance.
<br><br>
It is required that all vehicles possess a minimum of 6.5 inches of ground clearance and a maximum height of 6 feet and 4 inches.
<br><br>
If your vehicle does not meet the requirements for a regular auto trailer, we may not be able to accept it, which could increase your estimated rate.
<br><br>
<strong>The vehicle should be clean:</strong>
<br><br>
To facilitate the completion of an accurate vehicle inspection report, kindly ensure that your vehicle is cleaned beforehand. This will help you and the driver expedite the vehicle inspection during pick-up and drop-off.
<br><br>
<strong>How can I insure my vehicle for shipping?</strong>
<br><br>
It is possible to obtain vehicle insurance up to $100,000 from the FMCSA licensed carrier responsible for transporting your vehicle.
<br><br>
You can request a copy of the insurance certificate from any licensed carrier, and they will provide it to you. Mercury verifies the insurance of all carriers for each shipment.
<br><br>
<strong>Should I drive or ship my car?</strong>
<br><br>
This will depend on the age, condition, and distance you intend to transport your car. Any automobile may be driven safely over a short space of under 500 miles, but if yours needs frequent maintenance or has trouble handling lengthy distances, it might be more cost-effective to transport it.
<br><br>
<strong>When will my vehicle be collected for shipping?</strong>
<br><br>
Once an order is placed, we search our car carrier network to find a suitable truck and driver to transport your vehicle.
<br><br>
The seven-day timeframe for vehicle pickup is included in the regular option. If you select the expedited option, your car will be picked up in less than 72 hours.
<br><br>
For the enclosed option, your vehicle will be picked up within a 7-day window. We will assign the best available option and provide you with an estimated time for pickup. The truck driver will contact you in advance to confirm the details.
<br><br>
<strong>How can I receive a shipping estimate for a car?</strong>
<br><br>
You can contact a car transport service to request a quote for car shipment. To proceed with the shipment of your car, kindly furnish us with some details about your vehicle, including the pickup and delivery locations and your preferred mode of transportation.
<br><br>
Once the car transport service receives the necessary information, they will provide an estimate and offer to connect you with a carrier.
