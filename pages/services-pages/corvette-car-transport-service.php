                <p class="para-2">
                    Typically, it takes 3-6 days from state to state. The arrival time for a coast to coast shipment can range from 7 to 10 days. Check out our article on how long it takes for a detailed summary.
                </p>
                <p class="para-2">
                    Expect the carrier to cover anywhere between 300 and 500 kilometers per day as a general guideline. Weather and traffic conditions will have an impact on how long it takes. The other recipients of the cars' accessibility are also important.

                <p class="para-2">
                    The more expensive <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/enclosed-shipping" target="_blank">enclosed car shipping</a> choice has another benefit. Whether you're searching for antique shipping, Corvette classic vehicle transport, or any other kind of car transport service, some of these carriers hold fewer automobiles and may thus arrive more quickly because there are fewer drop-offs.

            <p class="para-faq">The price of covered automobile transportation ranges from $1,000 to more than $2,000, with an average rate of $1 per mile. Due to the need for specialized trailers and stricter security protocols, enclosed transport often costs between $500 and $2,000 more than open automobile transportation.

            <p class="para-faq">No. Our shipping service deals with both single vehicles as well as fleets. We can also ship within the continental US as well as internationally.
                <br><br>
                However, if taking vehicles overseas, documentation is necessary, and you may be required to cover customs costs and licensing and registration fees at your destination

            <p class="para-faq">The law requires us to confirm who owns the vehicle we're transporting and to have copies on hand in case the shipment is halted for a routine inspection.

            <p class="para-faq">We assist both domestic and international car transfers, although there may be additional expenses connected with importing a vehicle over international boundaries. When the car arrives at the target port, some countries want three notarized copies of the title.

            <p class="para-faq">Most auto transport firms will allow you to retain certain personal things in the vehicle while it is being moved. However, there are two critical points to remember:
