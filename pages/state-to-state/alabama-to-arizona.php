                            <p class="para-2">Open transit is the most common way of car shipping. Open-air transport is divided into two categories. Eight to ten car carriers handle the majority of freight. For shorter, more local movements, smaller carriers that hold 2-3 cars are employed. There is a bigger network of carrier availability since open-air carriers are used more frequently. Enclosed transportation methods are recommended for moving historic, premium, or exotic vehicles. On the road, enclosed carriers offer the best protection from open-air elements. We recommend booking your enclosed transportation in advance because carrier availability is limited. For local moves, we also have Flatbeds for Alabama to Arizona Car Shipping.

                            <p class="para-2">Check to see if your car has been thoroughly cleaned both inside and out. This is especially crucial because it will aid the driver's inspection in determining any pre-existing damage to your car. You'll also want to make sure the vehicle doesn't have any other personal belongings in it unless you want to ship them with it. Make sure the driver is aware of any unusual circumstances with the car. Finally, ensure that the automobile has a quarter tank of gas when it is picked up for shipping.
