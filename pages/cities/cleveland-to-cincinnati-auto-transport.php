<h2><b>What Does Rapid Auto Shipping Do?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Rapid Auto Shipping, we do our best to <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/cars" target="_blank"><strong>ship cars</strong></a> from Cleveland to Cincinnati. We have also been doing this for a long time. Our sales team is committed to ensuring you get the necessary auto transport. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you've made a reservation, the offices responsible for dispatch, support, and claims will ensure your shipment is treated well.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole process has been simplified into five easy steps, and we'll take care of each for you. The perks for you are that it's cheap, easy, and quick.</span>
<h3><b>Get a quote</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you choose a shipping company, getting a price quote is essential. This will give you a better idea of how much things cost and what <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services" target="_blank"><strong>services</strong></a> are offered. Make sure you tell each company the same things so they can give you an exact price.</span>
<h3><b>Set up the pick-up</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you agree to the price, you need to set up a transfer. You must let the shipping company know when the car is ready to be picked up.</span>
<h3><b>Get your car ready to be shipped</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll need to do some things before your car is shipped. Make sure your vehicle is clean and that all of your items are out of it. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure your vehicle is in good shape and doesn't leak oil or have other problems. Before the car is shipped, take shots and describe how it looks.</span>
<h3><b>Wait for delivery</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the car is on its way, you'll have to wait until it gets to you. The company should tell you when it thinks your package will arrive, so you can track it and make any plans at the location.</span>
<h3><b>Check your car when you get it</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes, Check the car when it gets to its location to make sure it's still in the same shape. Look over your vehicle for any damage and write it down. If there are any problems, you should take pictures and tell the <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/" target="_blank"><strong>shipping company</strong></a> immediately.</span>
<h2><b>Three Simple Steps to Get A Car Ready for Cleveland to Cincinnati Auto Transport</b></h2>
<h3><b> Write down the damage that is already there</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your car gets a scratch, ding, or dent, you'll be the first to know about it. If you write down all the damage that was already on your car, it will be easier for you and the driver to find any new damage that might happen.</span>
<h3><b>Wash the Car:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you wash the outside of your car thoroughly, you and the driver can see any damage better.</span>
<h3><b>Record Damage:</b></h3>
<b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write down any damage that was there before. You will compare your notes with the driver later.</span>
<h3><b>Use your camera: </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Get photos (with dates) of damage that was there before. If you want, you can also take pictures of your car from different angles.</span>
<h3><b>Get Driver Acknowledgement:</b></h3>
<b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share your notes with the driver about the damage that was already there. Have the driver sign a bill of goods or inspection report that says there is damage.</span>
<h3><b> Take out personal and after-market items</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto transport firms cannot transfer personal or home goods in vehicles they convey. Putting personal interests in your car is up to you. However, some carriers allow under 75 lbs in the trunk. Consider these before packing your vehicle:</span>
<h3><b>Damage May Occur to Items: </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Automobiles are not entirely immobile during conveyance. There is a minor disturbance on the vehicle that could cause damage to fragile objects.</span>
<h3><b>Carrier Can Refuse Service If: </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If carriers deem a vehicle unfit for transport due to the presence of personal objects, they may decline to transport the car.</span>
<h3><b>After-Market Items:</b></h3>
<b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend removing custom car stereos, sound systems, TVs, DVD players, GPS systems, etc., from your vehicle if it is not already equipped with these features.</span>
<h3><b>Antennas: </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove or retract all antennas.</span>
<h3><b>Toll Passes: </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On their route to delivery, carriers must pass through several tolls. To avoid toll charges, disable or remove toll passes from your vehicle.</span>
<h3><b> Conduct Mechanical Inspection</b></h3>
<strong>The following objects should be subjected to a mechanical inspection:</strong>
<br><br>
<b>Breaks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vehicle must have an operational braking system, including an emergency brake.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Battery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batteries must be charged to capacity and remain charged. If you have had battery issues in the past, we ask that you replace the battery.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Ignition: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is a specific method or technique to begin your car, communicate it to the driver.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Gas: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to safety and weight restrictions, we request that the gas reservoir be no more than a quarter full.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Tires: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tires must be properly inflated and able to drive.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Fluids: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill up all fluids, including the engine oil, transmission fluid, and coolant. Check for any leakage in fluids. Fluids could seep into other vehicles on the carrier, causing exterior paint damage.</span>
<h2><b>What Is the Price of Transporting A Car from Cleveland to Cincinnati Auto Transport?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things that affect how much it costs to ship a car from Cleveland to Cincinnati. The distance your car has to travel is the most obvious factor, followed by the make, model, and type of car. </span>

<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are as under:</span>

<h2><b>Open air Cleveland to Cincinnati Auto Transport</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular type of <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/car-shipping-services" target="_blank"><strong>car shipping service</strong></a> is open auto travel. It's easy to set up, easy to use, and a great deal for the money. Your car is transported on an open trailer with other vehicles by a company that ships cars.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They pick up and load your car from a place you choose and take it to your chosen site. It leaves your car open to the weather, but if you're on a tight budget, it's still the safest and most secure choice.</span>
<h2><b>Enclosed Cleveland to Cincinnati Auto Transport </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enclosed Cleveland to Cincinnati Auto Transport, also called enclosed vehicle transport or enclosed carrier auto transport, is a way to ship a vehicle that gives it extra safety. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you own a high-end, rare, or special car, <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/enclosed-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>enclosed car transport</strong></a> is the best way to get it from where it is now to where it needs to be. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With enclosed auto transport, you can move your car from point A to point B in a van that is completely covered on all four sides. This keeps the vehicle safe from the weather and road debris, so you don't have to worry about anything.</span>
<h2><b>What's the Difference Between Open and Closed Car Transport?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/open-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>open car transport</strong></a>, your car will be moved along with several others in an open van. Your vehicle will be exposed to the weather, dust, and dirt during open car travel. But open shipping is still a safe choice for people who want to ship their car for less money. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When covered car transportation is used, all four sides of the car are safe. With this choice, your car is moved using a trailer that keeps the weather out. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the service that people who own classic cars, luxury cars, antique cars, exotic cars, and expensive cars use most often to move their vehicles. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of covered car transport is a little higher than the cost of open transport; this service is usually 30%–40% more expensive.</span>
