<h2><strong>Preparing Your Vehicle for Transport |   Philadelphia to Orlando Auto Transport</strong></h2>
<strong>Here are some steps that can help you prepare for shipping:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Kindly ensure that the exterior of your vehicle is clean. It is recommended to clean your car thoroughly to ensure that it is entirely spotless, as dirt has the potential to hide marks.</li>
 	<li>Please inspect the exterior of your vehicle. Make sure to thoroughly examine your vehicle for any indications of dents, scratches, or discolorations. Taking note of any pre-existing damage is crucial.</li>
 	<li>For record-keeping, it is advisable to capture photographs of the existing damage. To ensure accuracy, it is recommended that you take pictures of any damage, such as scratches, dents, paint chips, and other types of damage, in addition to noting them down. This serves as evidence in case any damage is noticed after shipping. To ensure high-quality images, capturing photographs from multiple angles is recommended.</li>
 	<li>It is essential to perform regular maintenance on your vehicle to ensure its proper functioning and longevity. Inspect all the fluids in the car and check the tire pressure. To achieve optimal performance, it is recommended to ensure that the battery is fully charged. It is advisable to fill your tank partially. It is essential to ensure enough fuel in the tank to drive the vehicle onto a <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/shipping-a-dump-truck" target="_blank"><strong>truck</strong></a>, provided it is still in working condition.</li>
 	<li>Kindly ensure that all personal belongings are removed. Kindly remove personal belongings, such as GPS devices or chargers, from your vehicle. By taking this action, the probability of theft, damage, or loss is decreased.</li>
 	<li>Kindly furnish the driver with any pertinent information that may be required. Prepare written notes that inform the driver about any mechanical problems. Even though the vehicle will be driven very little, these instructions will assist in loading and unloading it onto a carrier.</li>
</ul>

Our company offers the quickest auto transport solution for shipping a car from Philadelphia to Orlando.
<br><br>
We have around 19,000 certified auto transport carriers that are available for hire in our network. If your vehicle has enough ground clearance to be driven onto an open trailer, open auto transport is probably the most cost-effective and optimal option for shipping your vehicle.
<h3><strong>Enclosed transport:</strong></h3>
Our <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/enclosed-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>Enclosed Transport service</strong></a> is designed to cater to the specific requirements of exotic cars, classic vehicles, high-end vehicles, or those too low to the ground to transport on an open trailer safely.
<br><br>
We guarantee that your car will be transported with the highest level of care and attention through our "white glove" service.
