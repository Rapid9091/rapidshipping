<h2><strong>Boston to Los Angeles Auto Transport Options</strong></h2>
If this is your first time shipping a vehicle from Boston to Los Angeles, you may wonder about your options. Open and enclosed vehicle shipping are the two most common types of auto transport.
<h3><strong>Open auto transport</strong></h3>
The most common vehicle transport method is with an <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/open-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>open auto transport</strong></a> company. It is also the least expensive method of transporting a vehicle.
<br><br>
The carrier transfers your car and several others onto a large open trailer. Using this procedure, as many as ten cars can be transported simultaneously.
<br><br>
The used trailers lack sides and a canopy, exposing your vehicle to the elements. However, it is still an efficient, secure, and cost-effective method of transporting automobiles from Boston to Los Angeles.
<h3><strong>Enclosed auto transport</strong></h3>
Your automobile will be transported utilizing a fully secured truck or trailer by a carrier that offers enclosed auto transport. Because they are transported in trucks or trailers, the automobiles are shielded from the elements, filth, grime from traffic, or dust.
<br><br>
Enclosed auto transport is the best option for shipping an antique, classic, expensive, or <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/exotic-cars" target="_blank"><strong>exotic car</strong></a>. You can be sure that your vehicle will reach its destination in the same condition as when it was picked up, thanks to the further protection provided.
  <br><br>
The cost is the main distinction between enclosed automobile shipments and open car transportation. Consider paying an additional 30% to 40%.
