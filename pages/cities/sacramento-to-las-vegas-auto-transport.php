Rapid Auto Shipping offers enclosed carriers that provide additional vehicle protection during transportation.

<h2><strong>Preparing Your Vehicle For Transport | Miami to Baltimore Auto Transport</strong></h2>
<strong>Here are some steps that can help you prepare for shipping:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Kindly ensure that the exterior of your vehicle is clean. It is recommended to clean your car thoroughly to ensure that it is entirely free of dirt, as dirt has the potential to hide marks.</li>
 	<li>Please inspect the exterior of your vehicle. Make sure to thoroughly examine your vehicle for any indications of dents, scratches, or discolorations. Taking note of any pre-existing damage is crucial.</li>
 	<li>For record-keeping, it is advisable to capture photographs of the existing damage. To ensure a comprehensive record of any damage, it is recommended to take pictures of scratches, dents, paint chips, and any other types of damage, in addition to noting them down. This serves as evidence in case any damage is noticed after shipping. For best results, it is advisable to take photographs from various angles and ensure that the image quality is high.</li>
 	<li>It is essential to perform regular maintenance on your vehicle to ensure its proper functioning. Inspect all the fluids in the car and check the tire pressure. To achieve optimal performance, it is recommended to ensure that the battery is fully charged. It is advisable to fill your tank partially. It is essential to ensure enough fuel in the tank to drive the vehicle onto a <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/truck-shipping-service" target="_blank"><strong>truck</strong></a>, provided it is still in working condition.</li>
 	<li>Kindly remove all personal belongings. Kindly ensure you have removed all personal belongings from your vehicle, including GPS or car charger. By taking this action, the probability of theft, damage, or loss is decreased.</li>
