And while it may appear to be a straightforward process, the reality is that there is a limit to the number of items that may be stored in your car while it is being transported. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Carriers are subject to stringent weight regulations, which they are required to adhere to, and an excessive number of vehicles that together carry an excessive amount of weight can cause a carrier to exceed its weight capacity.</span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Items in a car must be in the trunk. </span></li>

</ul>
<b>FAQ</b>
<br><br>
<b>What should I do about the damage that was done to my vehicle while it was being transported?</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The transportation company's insurance will cover transit damages. The driver will go around the car with you and mark any past damage on the report upon collection. To document and distinguish new damages from old ones. </span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You and the driver will check the car again after delivery, documenting any additional damages. After taking photographs and getting a repair shop quote, the truck's insurance will handle the rest.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Can I Still</b> <strong>Send</strong><b> My Car Even Though It Does Not Run?</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, special equipment is needed to winch and secure a non-running vehicle, which takes time and effort, and not all carriers have a winch. Ask a salesperson how much you must pay if your vehicle isn't operating.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Do Trucks Have Insurance, or do I?</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto transporters must hold nationally mandated liability and cargo insurance. While aboard a car transport truck, your vehicle is covered by the carrier, not your own insurance.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Which Is Better: Open or Closed Transport? </b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many variables affect that. We ship your automobile in an open container for open auto shipping. It's a cheap, fully insured auto shipping service that protects your vehicle from most harm.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Enclosed car transport moves your automobile in a hard- or soft-shell truck. Enclosed trailers protect automobiles from the elements and damage, but they cost more than open carriers.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Am I Allowed to Choose The Location Of My Pickup As Well As The Time of My Delivery?</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can choose a 2–4-hour pickup window. We respect your time. We need to know when to pick up your car. Customers seeking a certain pickup time may pay more.</span>
