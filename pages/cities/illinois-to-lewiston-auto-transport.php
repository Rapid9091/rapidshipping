<h2><strong>How Does Illinois to Lewiston Auto Transport Work?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Please get a price for shipping your vehicle:</strong></h3>
Rapid Auto Shipping is a reliable company specializing in car shipping services. We provide complimentary quotes without any obligation. When it comes to transporting your vehicle, you have the option to choose between an open or enclosed carrier.
<br><br>
Open-carrier shipping is a popular and <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/cost-to-ship-a-car" target="_blank"><strong>cost-effective</strong></a> transportation method for shipping. Rapid Auto Shipping offers enclosed carriers that provide additional automobile protection during transportation.
<h3><strong>Vehicle pickup:</strong></h3>
After receiving the price, you can book online or contact an auto transportation representative to schedule a pickup date. Your vehicle will be carefully loaded onto the carrier upon pickup.
<br><br>
Rapid Auto Shipping offers the convenience of online cargo tracking, allowing you to easily and quickly monitor the status of your shipment at any time.
<h3><strong>Vehicle delivery:</strong></h3>
Your car will be carefully unloaded from the auto transporter's truck after transportation. Performing a comprehensive final inspection will guarantee that the item is returned to you in the same condition as it was collected, without any harm or alterations.
<h2><strong>Preparing Your Vehicle for Transport| Illinois to Lewiston Auto Transport</strong></h2>
<strong>Here are some steps that can assist you in preparing for shipping:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Please clean the outside of your vehicle. It is advisable to thoroughly clean your car to ensure it is spotless, as dirt can potentially conceal marks.</li>
 	<li>Please examine the exterior of your vehicle. Inspect your vehicle for any signs of dents, scratches, or discolorations. It is essential to take note of any pre-existing damage.</li>
 	<li>It is recommended to take pictures of the current damage for record-keeping purposes. It is advisable to take photographs of any damage, including scratches, dents, paint chips, and other types of damage, in addition to noting them. This serves as proof in case any damage is observed after shipping. It is recommended to capture photographs from <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/multi-car-shipping"><strong>multiple</strong> </a>angles and ensure high image quality.</li>
 	<li>Perform necessary maintenance on your vehicle. Ensure you inspect all the fluids in the car and check the tire pressure. For optimal performance, it is advisable to ensure that the battery is fully charged. It is recommended that you only partially fill up your tank. However, ensuring enough fuel in the tank to drive the vehicle onto a truck is essential, provided it is still in working condition.</li>
 	<li>Please remove all personal belongings. Please remove any personal items from your vehicle, such as your GPS or car charger. By doing this, the likelihood of theft, damage, or loss is reduced.</li>
 	<li>Please provide the driver with any additional information that may be necessary. Create written notes that provide information to the driver regarding any mechanical issues. Although the vehicle will be driven minimally, these notes will help move it onto and off a carrier.</li>
</ul>
