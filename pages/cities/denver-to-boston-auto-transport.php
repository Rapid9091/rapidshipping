<br><br>
<b>Make and model of a car</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It costs less to ship smaller cars than it does to send bigger ones. Still, a racing car in a trailer with a roof could cost more than an SUV in an open trailer.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Transport type</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The usual way of travel in the business is <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/open-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>open auto transport</strong></a>. It costs the least to move a car this way. Car carriers with a roof cost more. They are different from other videos.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Distance</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The base price is based on the number of miles driven. Most of the time, longer distances cost more. The less your car costs per mile, the more miles it goes.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Location</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the car is going to or coming from a big city or a small town is essential. Rates are lower in big towns, but the opposite is true in rural areas.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Vehicle condition</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A winch or a forklift might be needed to load a car that isn't moving independently. This made the price go up.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Supply / Demand</b>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When there is a lot of demand, there is less room in the <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/truck-shipping-service" target="_blank"><strong>trucks</strong></a>, so prices go up. When quantity is low, it's the same.</span>
<h2><b>How Long Does It Take to Ship A Car From Boston to Denver?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping a car takes one to several days. The time to ship a car is split into two-time frames – the pick-up window and the delivery window. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, the pickup window lasts between one and five business days.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that, the delivery is based on the overall distance as well as a few other factors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact location is an essential factor that affects transport times. Other factors, such as road closures, weather, traffic, and further customer delays, could impact the delivery time. </span>
