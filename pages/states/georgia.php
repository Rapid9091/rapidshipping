                An auto transport company is contractually obligated to deliver your car in good condition. Upon receiving your vehicle, you can check it for any dents or scratches and take steps to recuperate your losses. Because of this, there are numerous precautions our drivers will take to prevent anything from happening to it. Each car is strapped in place, so it cannot move during transit. Beams protect it from outside elements, and enclosed carriers block such problems completely. The route our truck takes is also carefully mapped out to avoid gravel roads and any areas that may damage the cargo. Rapid Auto Transport is fully insured – You can have peace of mind knowing that in the unlikely event your car suffers damage during transport to Georgia, we have you covered – our insurance will get the claim handled quickly and efficiently.

                    Each winter, thousands of retirees from the north journey south to escape the frigid weather. Then they return north in time to watch spring blossom, they are known as snowbirds. Many snowbirds choose to drive their own vehicles, both routes, North and South. However, it is found that most experienced snowbirds that have learned that transporting a car save them a great deal of time, money, hassle, and wear and tear to their vehicles.

                    In general, all routes from north to south can be called snowbirds routes. The major snowbird states are Arizona, Texas, Florida, and California. During the snowbirds season car shipping prices on these routes go up. It is advisable that customers not be lured by the lowest prices on the market. The auto transport carriers have too many cars to choose from, and they go by the highest price, which means if you are not willing to pay more your car would not get shipped soon and will have to wait longer than expected.

                <p class="text">
                    A vehicle is considered operable or running if it can drive forward and in reverse under its power and steer with no additional work. Meaning the carrier would be able to drive the car onto and off of the truck. If your vehicle is considered inoperable or non-running, the driver must winch or push the car onto their truck, which will require a higher rate for performing these additional services. Not all transport trucks can accommodate inoperable vehicles.
