The following factors typically affect boat shipping costs:
<br><br>
<strong>Size and Weight: </strong>Your boat's size and weight will significantly affect how much it costs to move. Transporting bigger boats or yachts can be more expensive because they need bigger trailers, specialized equipment, and people who know how to use them.
<br><br>
