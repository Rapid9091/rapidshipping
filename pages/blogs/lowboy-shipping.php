                <p>
                    Lowboy trailers occasionally need to be moved. When a lowboy trailer needs to be moved to a new location, it can be readily pushed behind a semi-truck or even transported on another huge flatbed trailer to prevent tire wear and tear, though hauling it alone is usually the best option.

                    Companies use lowboys for a few extra benefits, such as reducing shipping costs for heavy equipment by avoiding over-dimension permits.

                    Lowboy trailers are often used to transport heavy machinery, while flatbed trailers are more frequently used to transport more common types of equipment. Bulldozers and excavators are two examples of large equipment that lowboys can assist in moving.

                    Finding a lowboy trailer variety that meets your particular demands will be easier if you are aware of the various lowboy trailer varieties. The three main varieties of lowboy trailers are fixed-neck, removable-neck, and gooseneck with a fixed-neck.

                    Consider a fixed gooseneck lowboy if you want a more convenient way to load drop decks from the trailer's back. On fixed gooseneck lowboys, backloading is simpler because of the movable gooseneck. Reattach the gooseneck after loading to help secure the payload.

                    Lowboys with fixed-necks are the lightest style available. Since the lowboy will be securely fastened to the front of the trailer, be ready to load your stuff from the back.
