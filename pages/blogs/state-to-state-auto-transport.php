   <br><br>

   <h2><strong>State-to-State Auto Transport Services Are Available In Both Open And Enclosed Options.</strong></h2>
   Two main types of trailers are used for state-to-state auto transport: open and enclosed car shipping services.
   <br><br>
   <strong>Open car transport </strong>
   <br><br>
   <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/open-car-shipping" target="_blank" ><strong>Open car transport</strong></a> trailers are considered the most commonly utilized method of shipping cars in the auto transport industry. One significant reason people, particularly car dealerships, prefer state-to-state auto transport is that it is relatively cheaper due to its ability to carry more cars.
   <br><br>
   The trailers used in open transport typically have multiple levels, allowing the company to load several cars simultaneously for transportation.
   <br><br>
   One disadvantage of utilizing an open trailer is that the cargo or vehicle transported is vulnerable to the surrounding environment and weather conditions.
