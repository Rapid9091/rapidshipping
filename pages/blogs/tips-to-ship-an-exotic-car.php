There are specific precautions and inquiries owners should make when exporting an exotic car, such as a Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Porsche, or other high-end automotive. Will the vehicle receive the necessary protection while in transit? Will both the inside and outside be kept in immaculate condition? Will the car be shielded from bad weather and the environment? We'll cover all of these subjects and more in this blog post so that you can ship your exotic car with greater confidence. ";

                    <p>During transit, protecting your exotic car is crucial. Vehicles transported in open car carriers are more vulnerable to road debris, mud, and bad weather. Because the car is kept safe inside the trailer during enclosed shipment, these potential sources of damage are eliminated. Exotic cars are protected from outside elements while being transported in enclosed spaces, but additional protection is also applied for these vehicles by covering them with fabric covers first, then another plastic covering on top of that. </p>

                        <br><br>
                        Cars can be loaded in one of two ways: by driving them onto a truck using ramps, or by utilizing a hydraulic liftgate. All of the trailers we use at Intercity Lines, Inc. have liftgates. Hydraulic lift gates are essential while shipping your exotic car for two reasons. The vehicle's underside, particularly the front bumper, may scrape during loading and unloading because many exotic cars have limited ground clearance. The front bumper and underside of the car are kept intact by using a hydraulic liftgate

                    <h2><span> What is the second advantage of employing hydraulic liftgates for transportation?  </span></h2>
                    <p>
                        Preventing clutch wear in the car. The driver must use the clutch to get the car up the ramps, which might cause excessive clutch wear if ramps are utilized to load the vehicle AND the driver is unskilled. Utilizing a hydraulic liftgate prevents the vehicle's clutch from undergoing needless wear.

                    <p>
                        Exotic automobiles must be carried with extreme caution and specialized equipment, as shown by the information previously supplied on the shipping method. In light of this, the price may be more than that of standard shipping services depending on various ancillary services offered by the transport providers.

                        Preparing the car for shipping is the first step in guaranteeing its safety during the journey, and it might be as important for all other operations.
                        <br><br> <b>Review the vehicle: </b> <br> It's crucial to inspect both the interior and exterior of the car and record any dings or other existing damage. The owner of the vehicle must have been made aware of the specific condition in order to determine whether any new damage was caused during transit.
                        <br><br> <b>Remove all personal things:</b> <br> from the exotic car to avoid any potential harm from the car's movements during transportation. Additionally, these items will get heavier, which will raise the cost of transportation.
                        <br><br><b> Obtain an inspection:</b> <br> It's recommended to move an exotic car with a quarter tank of gas. Checking the battery charge and tyre pressure is also essential.
