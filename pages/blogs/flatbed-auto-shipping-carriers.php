This is due to the relatively low demand for flatbed shipping; if 95% of all vehicles shipped annually are transported using open transport trucks, another 3% are transported using enclosed auto shipping carriers, and 1% are motorcycles, then only a small portion of vehicles are transported using flatbeds. In contrast to the majority of auto transport companies, flatbed carriers generally do not follow predetermined routes; instead, they travel a wide area while using little gasoline. ";

                    <p> Almost everything that won't fit on an open auto shipment carrier is transported by flatbed shippers. Larger vehicles like limousines, lifted trucks and SUVs, construction equipment, and pretty much anything else you can think of that is large will usually need to be transported on a flatbed Carrier. We will do our utmost to transfer your vehicle on an open carrier because flatbed auto shipping is not the simplest mode of transport to reserve, but occasionally there is just too much mass or the vehicle is just too huge to fit, in which case we will start looking for a flatbed carrier for your vehicle.
                        <br><br>
                        If you let us know your vehicle's measurements in advance, you can both save us time and yourself some trouble. Most vehicles don't need to be measured, but we'll need to know if yours has been lifted, stretched, or otherwise altered to be longer, taller, or wider. Before everything else, make sure you know the exact year, make, and model of your car because these are the quickest ways to identify a car, especially if you're hauling a pickup truck or an SUV. Please inform us of any modifications after we receive the year, make, and model from you. We will then decide whether we require the complete dimensions of the vehicle.

                    <p>
                        The cost of flatbed varies depending on a variety of variables, such as where you're shipping from, where you're shipping to, what you're shipping, the cost of diesel at the time of shipment, and the firm you're utilizing for transportation.
                        <br><br> The amount of trucks that your flatbed freight carrier has available might also affect flatbed auto shipping charges. Your flatbed price will be better and vice versa depending on how many flatbed vehicles are available.
                        The time of year might also affect the price of flatbed shipment. Flatbed auto shipping services are in greater demand throughout the summer because there is more construction taking on. Flatbed trucking costs thus tend to increase during such months.
                        <br><br> Get a free flatbed quote from Rapid Auto Shipping if you're seeking the finest flatbed auto shipping rates. We can assist you in locating the most affordable flatbed trucking rates per mile for your shipment because we have access to several transportation providers across the nation.
