                <h2>CLASSIC CAR SHIPPING (RAS)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In another state or across the country, rare and distinctive vehicles are frequently discovered. That shouldn't prevent you from purchasing your ideal vehicle. Finding qualified historic automobile transport experts nationwide is simple with rapid auto shipping.

                    <br> There are a few best practices that practically every auto transport business will promote because transporting classic cars does take a little additional care. When it comes to our historic car transport service, we always recommend that customers select enclosed auto transport because it provides the fastest and safest mode of delivery. Additionally, we advise shipping vintage cars "door to door," which means the shipping firm will bring the vehicle to your home or another address of your choice. If convenience and safety are priorities for you, selecting enclosed auto transport makes sense.

                    <br><br>
                    <b> COST TO SHIP CLASSIC CAR TRANSPORT </b>
                    <br>
                    The price to move a vintage car varies according to the distance, timeline, and transportation service that is most convenient for you. Transporting your vintage car less than 1000 miles will cost you $1.15 per mile on average compared to shipping your car less than 100 miles for $3.35 per mile.
                    <br>
                    Visit our article on the cost to ship antique autos for more information about how much it can cost to ship your historic car. You may watch the process in action by browsing through the Rapid Auto Shipping marketplace's many completed classic automobile shipments.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>TIME TO TRANSPORT OF YOUR CLASSIC CAR ?</b>
                    <br>
                    Depending on where the automobile is parked, the typical pickup window is between 24 and 72 hours after the time it is ready to be picked up. In distant areas, picking up this window could take up to 5 days.
                    For distances under 1,000 miles, the turnaround time for Classic Car Transport is two to three days.
                    It is anticipated that the voyage from 1,000 to 1700 will take 4-6 days.
                    The distance between 1,750 and 2,500 is expected to be travelled in 7–10 days
                    <br><br>
                    <b>GET YOUR CLASSIC CAR READY FOR TRANSPORT ?</b>
                    <br>
                    In addition to what our antique car shippers can accomplish due to their prior knowledge, you can also get your vehicle ready for shipping by doing the following:
                    <br><br>
                    1. Clean Your Car

                    Clean and wash the inside and outside of your car. For transportation, the car needs to be practically completely empty.
                    <br> <br>
                    2. Identify and Record Damage

                    Picture any dents or scratches that are already present. Pictures offer accurate proof in the event of a dispute over damage.
                    <br> <br>
                    3. Discard Aftermarket Components

                    Antennas, DVD players, baggage racks, bike racks, toll passes, and other items are just a few examples of these parts and components.
                    <br> <br>
                    4. 1/4 Gas Tank

                    An almost empty tank will save weight and prevent unnecessary fees. Reduce the gas level in the tank to a quarter or an eighth.
                    <br> <br>
                    5. Conduct a mechanical inspection

                    Check the battery, ignition, tyres, fluids, and breaks, including emergency brakes. Minor leaks might result in serious issues, especially if the automobile is being driven hundreds of kilometers.

            WHICH IS THE BEST TRAILER TO SHIP A <span>CLASSIC CAR</span> ?
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            An enclosed trailer works best for transporting vintage or exotic vehicles. Open trailers and enclosed trailers are the two types of trailers used by carriers to move automobiles. You are in charge with Rapid Auto Shipping, so you can decide which sort of trailer is ideal for your particular shipment.

            There are a few best practices that practically every auto transport business will promote because transporting classic cars does take a little additional care. When it comes to our historic car transport service, we always recommend that customers select enclosed auto transport because it provides the fastest and safest mode of delivery. Additionally, we advise shipping vintage cars "door to door," which means the shipping firm will bring the vehicle to your home or another address of your choice. If convenience and safety are priorities for you, selecting enclosed auto transport makes sense.
            <br><br>
            Your antique car will be transported on an exposed trailer as part of an "open transport" arrangement. Your car will be subjected to a range of weather scenarios as well as the atmosphere that comes with traveling. Nevertheless, open transport is the most typical method of shipping a car because open trailers are more widely available and less expensive.

            Even if open transport is less expensive, enclosed transport for a vintage car is worthwhile. The best enclosed trailers for hauling a vintage car offer additional protection from the elements of the road. For this reason, covered trailers are typically used by carriers who specialize in transporting vintage or exotic cars.
