<br><br>
Many people wonder how much enclosed automobile travel costs per mile. In reality, this cost is determined by a number of factors, including:
<br><br>
<strong>Vehicle Size:</strong> Enclosed automobile transportation charges are determined by vehicle size. Why? Because bigger automobiles take up more space on trucks, leaving less room for other vehicles.
<br><br>
As a result, the enclosed automobile transport cost per mile will differ depending on whether the car is small, mid-sized, truck, <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/suv-auto-transport" target="_blank"><strong>SUV</strong></a>, or minivan.
    <br><br>
<strong>Vehicle Type:</strong> Because vintage and premium automobiles require extra special attention, enclosed auto shipping charges tend to be higher. In most situations, these vehicles need lift-gate elevators in addition to cover shipping, which represents a lower risk of damage than ramps.
<br><br>
Similarly, enclosed transport trailers from door to door helps guarantee that the vehicle is safeguarded from loading to unloading.
<br><br>
<strong>Distance:</strong> There is a starting charge of roughly $1 per mile for the first 500 miles. That means that the starting charge for a 275-mile journey would be $275. For more than 1,000 miles, the enclosed automobile transport cost per mile will often decrease.
<br><br>
When moving your automobile across the <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/states" target="_blank"><strong>United States</strong></a>, the enclosed car transport cost per mile can be as low as $0.40-50.
<br><br>
<strong>Destination:</strong> Shipping an automobile from one major city to another through main roads is usually less expensive than shipping it across the country.
<br><br>
If your pickup or shipment location is difficult to access - because it is distant from or challenging to get from the nearest highway - it will almost certainly cost extra.
<br><br>
<strong>Fuel Price:</strong> The price of gasoline changes constantly, affecting the cost of enclosed automobile travel per mile. As a result, if gasoline prices are low, you will profit from cheaper enclosed vehicle transport prices.
<br><br>
<strong>Surcharges:</strong> Surcharges are another aspect that will impact your enclosed auto transport prices, especially if you are moving your automobile across the United States. Surcharges might include:
<ul>
 	<li>Fees for leaving the state.</li>
 	<li>Staying overnight.</li>
 	<li>Using toll highways, among other things.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Date:</strong> Prices vary based on the time of year. Summer automobile shipping usually is more expensive since trucks load up quickly with visitors visiting the country's destinations. Semis charge extra because competition is so fierce.
<br><br>
Summer enclosed automobile shipping charges might be up to $300 more than winter rates. Enclosed vehicle transport prices for travels returning north tend to be cheaper throughout the winter when snowbirds fly south, but rates are normally higher over the holidays.
<br><br>
*Shipping your automobile around the holidays may take a few days longer due to service backups in the last weeks of December. As a result, truckers are playing catch-up in January.
<br><br>
<strong>Insurance:</strong> If your vehicle is uncommon or very valuable, additional insurance may be necessary, incurring additional fees (which vary by carrier).
<br><br>
<strong>Same Day / Expedited Auto Shipping:</strong> If you need your enclosed auto shipping picked up the same day, you will be charged an extra cost. We may need to hire a truck with two fully licensed drivers depending on the distance your automobile has to be delivered.
<br><br>
Unlike typical vehicle shipment, which requires the driver to pull into a safe rest stop overnight for a well-deserved nap, accelerated shipping requires one driver to rest while the other drives. As a result, the expedited shipment might cost between $200 and $500 more.
<br><br>

<h2><strong>Checklist to Refer to Before Preparing A Car For Shipping:</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Remove any loose, personal, or hanging things from your car since they may cause internal damage to the inside, windshield, and dashboard.</li>
 	<li>Visit your dealer or <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services" target="_blank"><strong>service</strong> </a>shop, complete all routine maintenance, and wash your car.</li>
 	<li>Conduct a pre-shipment check, noting vehicle condition, pre-existing damage, and other characteristics.</li>
 	<li>Take footage of your car before and during loading onto the container (or) enclosed trailer.</li>
 	<li>Assuming your vehicle is functioning, ensure it has adequate gasoline and battery power to load and unload.</li>
 	<li>Keep your keys and give the other set to the courier who requires them.</li>
 	<li>Check your odometer mileage, take notes, and snap photographs.</li>
 	<li>Examine the wheels and take photographs since any odd wear and tear might be disputed with the carrier.</li>
 	<li>If your automobile has just been painted, use car wax to preserve it during transportation. Even if the car is delivered in an enclosed trailer, it may become dusty and unclean.</li>
 	<li>Examine your auto insurance policy and, if required, renew it.</li>
 	<li>Keep a set of photocopies of your vehicle ownership documentation, automobile registration, insurance, shipment agreement, and any signed papers.</li>
 	<li>If your package must be retrieved by someone else at the destination, give the carrier the person's essential documentation. The person would be delivered when they verified the individual at the time of delivery.</li>
 	<li>If feasible, attempt to be at the location before the cargo and accept delivery yourself.</li>
 	<li>If someone else must handle the delivery, ask them to check the car while unloading and, before signing the delivery slip, if they see any concerns with the vehicle, physical damage, or wear and tear. Then you may create a video to claim transit insurance and file a grievance with the provider.</li>
 	<li>Confirm that all documentation and vehicle shipment copies are correctly completed, then sign them and have the carrier sign the agreement. Keep these documents secure by photographing/scanning and photocopying them.</li>
