<h2><strong>Types Of Auto Transport Service We Offer To Our Clients</strong></h2>
We offer multiple ways of transporting a vehicle from one place to another. You can choose anyone, whichever you prefer.
<h3><strong>Open Air Auto Transport Service</strong></h3>
Open-air auto transport service is a method of shipping your vehicle in an open container. This is the most admired way of transporting wheels.
<br><br>
Shipping your car in an open carrier from one place to another is cheaper than other modes of auto transport service. In this kind of auto transport, we load your car with another eight to ten cars.
<br><br>
<a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/open-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>Open-air car shipping</strong></a> comes with many pros and cons, like the fact that it is a way more affordable and faster way of shipping in comparison to enclosed auto transport.
<br><br>
Open-air auto transport service provides less protection to the vehicle when we compare it to enclose. This is a commonly used method, so it is way cheaper because of its availability.
<br><br>
It is not like enclosed services, so it is not shielded, because of which your car can face problems like rain, dust, storms, etc.
<h3><strong>Enclosed Auto Transport Service</strong></h3>
By using an enclosed auto transport service, you can add more safety to the wheels that are going to be transported, as it comes with a customized hydraulic system for loading and unloading.
<br><br>
Rapid auto shipping service prefers this method because of its high safety. An enclosed trailer protects your vehicle from the outside meteorological conditions. If you are planning to ship your vehicle in the winter, then this is the best option for you and your car.
<br><br>
It is costlier than open-air auto transport, but it is worth choosing this method to avoid any mishaps. For transporting luxury cars and sports cars, single-vehicle enclosed trailers are also used.
<br><br>
The steel and aluminium walls of enclosed containers give more protection to the vehicles that are inside the container.
<h3><strong>Door To Door Auto Transport Service</strong></h3>
In <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/door-to-door" target="_blank"><strong>door to door auto transport service</strong></a>, your vehicle is picked up from your current location and dropped off at a pre-planned destination. You can choose any location of your choice to pick up and drop off the vehicle.
<br><br>
It is convenient for customers to avoid any burden. It also gives you relief from logistical problems in shipping. It is a time-effective process by eliminating terminals for dropping and picking up.
<h3><strong>Terminal To Terminal Auto Transport Service</strong></h3>
Terminal-to-terminal is one of the methods used in auto transport services. It is not like a door-to-door auto transport service, where the vehicle is transported from your current location to another location; it requires a terminal where the vehicles are dropped off by the owner at a pre-planned location for pickup, and you can pick them up from another pre-planned location.
<br><br>
<a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/terminal-to-terminal-auto-transport" target="_blank"><strong>Terminal to terminal auto transport</strong></a> is the best way to ship cars. It is cheaper but takes more time than usual.
<h2><strong>Prepare The Car For Loading</strong></h2>
Before loading your vehicle on the shipping carrier, make sure to take pictures from all four sides of your vehicle in the presence of the carrier driver. To avoid any problems in the future, it is important to note these things down.
<br><br>
Take a picture of the odometer, too, for any fluctuations in mileage after the ride. At the point of delivery, check your vehicle closely and your odometer too.
<h3><strong> Clean Your Motor Vehicle</strong></h3>
Washing the outside of your car should be your first order of business after getting it. When the person who is picking up your car comes, he or she will complete a vehicle condition report with you.
<br><br>
This report describes the current state of the car, including any pre-existing damage that may be present on the vehicle.
<h3><strong> Turn off both the alarm and the sensors</strong></h3>
The loud sound of your automobile alarm is the very last thing a driver of a transporter wants to have to listen to. Be sure to turn off the alarm before transporting the item to avoid this problem.
<br><br>
You should also turn off other safety-related equipment, such as parking sensors because the noise they make can also be a distraction for the driver.
<h3><strong> Make sure there are no punctures or leaks in the tires</strong></h3>
It is possible for underinflated tires to be damaged when being hoisted onto and off of a truck; thus, you should ensure that your tires have the appropriate amount of pressure, just like you would if you were driving the vehicle yourself.
<br><br>
It is essential that you check the underside of the vehicle to ensure that there are no leaks coming from there. When loading and unloading a vehicle, oil leaks pose a significant risk.
<br><br>
As a result, certain transportation companies may refuse to handle your vehicle if there is evidence of oil leaks. In the event that you discover oil leaks or flat tires, you should attend to them as quickly as possible.
<h3><strong> Check to see if the automobile door is locked</strong></h3>
Even though this is something that should be clear, it is easy to forget, especially when your vehicle is being held in place on the back of a flatbed truck by heavy-duty straps while it is being transported.
<br><br>
It is in everyone's best interest to never give an adventurous burglar a chance to test his luck with their theft.
<h3><strong> Take off any personalized attachments</strong></h3>
Be sure to remove any unique components or accessories from the vehicle before it is placed onto the <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/how-to-ship-a-truck" target="_blank"><strong>truck</strong> </a>in order to reduce the likelihood of the vehicle's spoiler or other specialty accessories breaking in transit owing to their unusual dimensions.
