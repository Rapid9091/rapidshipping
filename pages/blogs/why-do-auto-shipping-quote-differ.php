                    <p>
                        Not all car shipping agents are totally honest up front. The upfront quotes from the less honest companies could be inexpensive, but they might not be very accurate. That's because they can contain various unstated fees or fees that won't become apparent right away. Some of these fees might be:
                        <br><br> Fees for pick-up, delivery, hook-up, mileage (beyond a specified amount), and tolls on state highways;

                        Of course, while some auto shipping businesses conceal these additional costs in their first quotes, businesses like Rapid Auto Shipping are upfront about all costs right away. The variations in the quotes that you receive may be explained by this.

                    <p>
                        Remember that each company uses a separate set of prices to calculate your charges per mile when you enter your information to receive an <em style="font-style: normal;"><b><span>auto transport quote</span></b></em>. Even though you might be entering the identical data with two different businesses, one business might charge more per mile than the other.

                    <p>
                        When a shipment is ordered today but becomes available a few weeks later, the market could alter for a number of different reasons (gas price change, season change, weather conditions, etc.). Please be careful to let us know when you schedule a shipment what time the pickup will be so that the price can be modified.

                    <h2><span>Relationships with Carriers for the Auto Transport Broker </span></h2>
                    <p>
                        Because of their contacts with certain carriers, some vehicle transport brokers can offer their clients cheaper prices. This typically involves the carrier giving the broker a lower price, which they make up for by giving them a constant flow of customers. Many brokers value their carrier partnerships because they enable them to both boost their profit margins and pass some of the savings on to their clients.

                        A carrier that is hauling more vehicles over a particular route may occasionally charge less than a carrier who is transporting fewer vehicles. One who is moving merely two automobiles along the same road will be charged more than one who is transporting seven vehicles on a trailer. Larger auto shipping companies frequently offer lower pricing as a result. Through the volume of sales, they are able to offset the price gap with smaller businesses.
