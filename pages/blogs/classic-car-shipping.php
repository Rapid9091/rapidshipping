   <h1>Classic Car Shipping</h1>
   Classic car shipping, also called exotic, luxury, expensive, or antique car transport, is a service for transporting valuable cars like exotic, luxury, classic, and sports cars. It's a premium service that offers extra protection for your vehicle and complete peace of mind.
<h2><strong>What Is the Process For Classic Shipping Cars?</strong></h2>
Classic car shipping can be done in a variety of ways. <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/best-autoshipping-company-usa" target="_blank"><strong>Auto shipping companies</strong></a> typically choose the enclosed carrier technology to transport vintage autos after carefully examining the situation and considering their clients' preferences.
<br><br>
Enclosed carriers offer the most significant safety and security during the procedure. Auto shipping firms will only transport your vintage car in modern enclosed containers.
<br><br>
Across all states, their strong carrier network can offer top-notch services for automotive transportation. You may depend on their fleet of covered carriers to transport your ordinary vehicles, whether you're a buyer, collector, or vendor of vintage cars.
<h2><strong>Types of Classic Car Shipping </strong></h2>
When <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/classic-car-shipping-services-provider" target="_blank"><strong>shipping classic cars</strong></a>, you have a few options. The best one for you will rely on how comfortable you want to be and how well your vehicle needs to be protected.
<h3><strong>Open Car Shipping</strong></h3>
RORO transport, or roll-on/roll-off transport, entails driving your vehicle onto the deck of a specially equipped cargo ship, where it will be lodged and secured alongside other cars.
<br><br>
This method involves transferring your vehicle onto an open trailer and securing it. <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/open-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>Open transport</strong></a> is typically less expensive due to the reduced cost of classic car shipping, but it provides less protection for your vehicle.
<br><br>
Even if your car is covered, it is susceptible to scratches, dents, and damage from inclement weather. This final point should be of particular concern if you reside in a hail-prone region.
<h3><strong>Enclosed Car Shipping</strong></h3>
Your vehicle is loaded into an enclosed trailer and secured, and the exterior door is sealed and fastened for a safer classic car shipping option. A classic car can also be transported across the ocean in a steel shipping container.
<br><br>
Up to 40 feet long, these containers are fully <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/enclosed-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>enclosed shipping</strong></a>, similar to box trailers, and your vehicle is secured within. The containers are then transported on a ship.
<h2><strong>What Is The Most Secure Method For Shipping Classic Car Shipping?</strong></h2>
Open car transport is the most prevalent service for transporting vehicles. It is economical, swift, and simple to arrange. It's enough for the average sedan, but more expensive and valuable car owners prefer to move their cars in an enclosed trailer.
<br><br>
The level of protection provided for the cars is a disadvantage of this <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services" target="_blank"><strong>auto transport service</strong></a>. Due to its added security, you can travel knowing that your prized possession is safe and secure.
<h2><strong>How to Transport A Classic Car?</strong></h2>
<strong>Transporting a classic car is a relatively simple procedure:</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Plan the shipment:</strong> You will save the most money if you get quotes at least two weeks before sending your vehicle. Expedited shipping incurs additional fees.
<br><br>
<strong>Get</strong> <strong>quotes</strong>: Car shipping brokers can access to various networks of enclosed carriers; therefore, comparing <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/car-transport-quotes" target="_blank"><strong>car shipping quotes</strong></a> online is prudent.
    <br><br>
<strong>Prepare</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>car</strong>: Take everything personally out of your car, wash it, and make sure there are no technical problems.
<br><br>
<strong>Document</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>car's</strong> <strong>condition</strong>: On the day of pickup, you'll sign a bill of lading that says what shape the car is in. At this time, it's also a good idea to take pictures.
<br><br>
<strong>Check</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>car</strong> <strong>when</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>drop</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>off</strong>: You will check it for damage and sign a bill of lading at drop-off.
<br><br>
<strong>Ensure Your Car Has Insurance</strong>
<br><br>
In addition, it is crucial to have an agreed-value insurance policy for your classic car. If your classic automobile is damaged, you should cover its total value.
<br><br>
Car transportation companies carry their insurance policies with high limits, but these policies apply primarily when the driver is at fault for an accident or damage.
<br><br>
If another motorist collides with the transporter, the other driver's property damage insurance may not cover all the damages.
<br><br>
You'd have to use your insurance policy, so it's essential to have the total value covered, not just the book value, as the latter does not apply to collectible vehicles.
<h2><strong>What Is The Cost of Classic Car Shipping?</strong></h2>
Some fundamental factors determine the price of classic car shipping, the most important of which is the shipping distance—cities, space, potential <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/cost-to-ship-a-car" target="_blank"><strong>costs</strong></a>, and estimated delivery times.
<br><br>
Since most classic cars are transported in enclosed vehicles, the greater the delivery distance, the cheaper the per-mile rate. About $2 per mile is the average cost of classic car shipping.
<h2><strong>How Long Does Classic Car Shipping Take?</strong></h2>
Many things affect how long it takes to move a car. The most straightforward thing is distance. But the location where your vehicle is picked up and dropped off, the weather, and the time of year can also change the time it takes to move your car.
<br><br>
The Department of Transportation also limits drivers' hours to ensure truck drivers are well-rested and can drive safely.
