                </h2>
                <p>

                    <b> BILL OF LADING</b><br>

                    An old English verb that implies "to load" is "lading." An official receipt or written statement is referred to as a "bill." As a result, the Bill of Lading serves as a record of the loading of your car onto a carrier.

                    The necessity of this paperwork, sometimes known as the "BoL," cannot be overstated while transporting your car. It is evidence that a carrier has your car and that it was in good shape when it was picked up and delivered.

                    Prior to signing this agreement, it is imperative that you make note of any damage to your car. Repairs won't be paid for by insurance carriers unless the damage has been recorded in the Bill of Lading.

                    <br><br><b>TERMS & CONDITIONS OF INSURANCE</b><br>

                    As a customer, you normally don't need insurance to send your automobile, but your auto shipping company most likely does.

                    You should confirm that the transporters you're considering are sufficiently insured because coverage amounts can vary.

                    Before you sign on the dotted line, always review the terms and conditions of your insurance coverage information.

                    <br><br><b>LIENHOLDER AUTHORIZATION</b><br>

                    You may need to obtain formal approval from the lienholder (such as your financial institution) before exporting an automobile if you're still making payments on your vehicle loan.

                    We use the word "sometimes" because a lienholder's consent is only required if the car shipper will be using a sea port. The only state to which this truly applies is Hawaii, but if you're unsure, you can always check with your financial institution.

                    <br><br><b>ABSENCE OF OWNER AUTHORIZATION</b><br>

                    Only if your vehicle is being exported through a port will this document be necessary. If you wish to give someone else permission to pick up your car at the destination port instead of you, you will need this.

                    <br><br><b>PROOF OF INSURANCE</b><br>

                    Rarely is a customer needed to obtain personal insurance for their vehicle in order to ship their vehicle. However, not every shipping company will have sufficient insurance for the kind of vehicle you have. You might want to investigate additional shipping coverage options from your own insurance provider in these circumstances.

                    <br><br><b>BOTH REGISTRATION AND TITLE</b><br>

                    Your vehicle's title attests to your ownership of it, while the registration attests to the fact that it complies with all local and federal laws (the police can identify you when they scan your licence plate).

                    The majority of businesses don't request these documents, but it never hurts to check with your carrier to see if shipping your automobile involves providing a title and registration.

                    <br><br><b>A PHOTO ID</b><br>

                    Rarely is a photo ID needed to ship a car. The key question here is whether transportation corporations want the data for their own databases or not. Typically, all you need is a driver's licence when a photo ID is required.



                    Even while the majority of businesses won't need all of the aforementioned documents from you, it's always advisable to ask what papers you might need to gather before shipping. To make sure everything is current and to give yourself enough time to get in touch with your lienholder, if necessary, we advise finding your papers early in the process.


                    <br><br><b>IN SHORT: CAR SHIPMENT DOCUMENTATION</b><br>

                    When transporting your car, you must always deal with the following two documents: (1) The bill of lading and (2) the terms and conditions of the insurance.

                    When your car enters a port, additional paperwork such as lienholder and absent owner authorizations are required.

                    While some businesses may request information such as your photo ID, proof of insurance, and title and registration, these documents are not legally necessary to send your automobile.

            What does a shipping note mean?
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            We can prepare the documentation to allow access to the port of departure for your vehicle once we have booked a reservation for you with the shipping line. A shipping notice is what it is called.

            The shipping note includes a detailed description of your vehicle to be delivered along with the booking number, vessel information, port of export, and port of arrival. You will be denied entry to the port and your vehicle won't be allowed if you don't bring the shipping note with you when you deliver your vehicle. Your shipping note is a crucial piece of paper. The driver must bring a copy with him if the car is being delivered on your behalf. This will have a port stamp on it, serving as your delivery proof.

            Any of the additional options stated below in our contact sheet or on our contact page, as well as through phone or email, are ways you can reach us right now. We anticipate hearing from you.
