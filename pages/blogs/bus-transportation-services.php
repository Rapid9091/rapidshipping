                    <p>Buses are available in various weights, dimensions, and even forms. However, they are typically long, broad, and tall, ranging in height from 10 to 14 feet, breadth from 8 to 8.5 feet, and weight from 20,00 to  40,000 pounds.

                    <p>Buses are, therefore, significant and weighty. This indicates that buses need unique transit trailers and, occasionally, special shipping licenses. Professional heavy machinery haulers can choose the best trailer by following the instructions in the owner's handbook and the particular loading rating information on each bus' identifying plate.</p>
