   <h1>Shipping Heavy Equipment</h1>
   Shipping heavy equipment can be a daunting task. Shipping any goods involves numerous variables, which can be intimidating. Fortunately, several freight firms specialize in this company and can assist you with shipping heavy equipment needs.
<h2><strong>Methods of Shipping</strong></h2>
Containers, LoLo, RoRo, and flat racks are the four most common ways to shipping heavy equipment. How you want your equipment to arrive and whether it needs special shipping because of its size will help you decide how to get it there.
<br><br>
A mix of these methods may sometimes be required, but flatbed trucking is almost always needed to get cargo where it needs to go.
<br><br>
<strong> Container shipping</strong>: A container is the safest way to <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/heavy-equipment-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>ship heavy equipment</strong></a>. It best protects you from the weather and works well for long trips. But it is also one of the most expensive options for companies that ship big machinery.
<br><br>
Only certain kinds of heavy machines can fit in a shipping container. If this is true for your shipment, you'll need to find a different way to see heavy equipment transporters in your area.
<br><br>
<strong>2: The LoLo Method:</strong> The lift-on/lift-off method is the best way to move cars that don't work and machines that can't move. This includes motors, farm equipment, and other heavy things too big to fit on a flatbed or ship. If you choose heavy equipment shipping companies that use this method, a giant crane will lift and move your equipment.
<br><br>
<strong> Roll-on/Roll-off:</strong> This method, called the RoRo method, is often used to ship extensive, heavy equipment overseas. But it can also move a lot of gear within the country.
<br><br>
As the name suggests, this method involves putting the machines on flatbed trucks where they are picked up and taking them off when they reach their final destination. RoRo is cheap, fast, and works well.
<br><br>
<strong>Flat Rack Transportation</strong>: Flat rack carriers can be used to move boats, <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/rv-shipping-usa" target="_blank"><strong>RVs</strong></a>, and other significant pieces of equipment. Heavy equipment shipping companies also use a flat rack, a flexible platform for safely moving equipment.
<br><br>
It is also cheaper than container shipping because it is done in the open air. But once it leaves the pickup spot, your heavy equipment won't be protected from the weather. So, this method of transportation can be done without a permit.
<h2><strong>What Is The Cost Of Shipping Heavy Equipment?</strong></h2>
The cost of shipping heavy equipment is highly dependent on the type of equipment being moved. Shipping heavy equipment over lengths of more than 500 miles costs an average of $1.75 per mile, while the average cost for shorter distances is $5.00 per mile.
<h2><strong>What Factors Determine The Price Of Shipping Heavy Equipment? </strong></h2>
How much it costs to ship heavy equipment depends on many things. Overhead costs include insurance, broker fees, packaging materials, travel, and tracking. But the most important things are these:
<br><br>
<strong>Dimensions of Your Heavy Equipment</strong>
<br><br>
The larger or more unusually shaped your equipment, the more likely it will require specialized trailers, permits, or routing requirements, increasing your <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/cost-to-ship-a-car" target="_blank"><strong>shipping costs</strong></a>.
<br><br>
<strong>Time of Shipping</strong>
<br><br>
If you need your equipment delivered at a specific time, the shipping cost will likely increase.
<br><br>
<strong>Location of Delivery and Pickup</strong>
<br><br>
The greater the distance your apparatus must travel, the greater the cost. In addition, increased congestion (think cities) at or near your pickup or delivery location can increase your shipping costs.
<br><br>
<strong>Annual Season</strong>
<br><br>
Your pricing may be affected if specific routes are closed due to adverse weather conditions, such as during the snowy and frigid winter months or hurricane season.
<br><br>
In addition, there is a prime shipping season for flatbeds from April to October, which increases demand – and rates.
<br><br>
<strong>Current Fuel Rates</strong>
<br><br>
The more expensive fuel is, the higher your shipping costs will be.
<br><br>
<strong>Required permits and licenses </strong>
<br><br>
Oversize or overweight permits may be required for shipping heavy equipment. Costs can vary by state or province, and some <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/states" target="_blank"><strong>states</strong> </a>may take longer to issue permits due to their distinctive infrastructure and regulations.
    <br><br>
<strong>Escorts Required</strong>
<br><br>
Having to pay for escorts will increase your shipping costs. Check the freight's route to determine if escort vehicles are necessary if it is wider or taller than 12 feet.
<h2><strong>How Long Does Shipping Heavy Equipment Take?</strong></h2>
The travel distance is crucial in determining how long it takes for heavy equipment to reach its destination port. Other things that affect the time of the way are:
    <br><br>
<strong>The mode of transport: </strong>In the case of an LTL shipment, transportation from quay to truck to dock takes longer. In addition, rail transport is more time-consuming than vehicle transport.
<br><br>
<strong>Oversized loads: </strong>Auto transport companies must conform to local regulations. Special permits are required for specific oversize cargoes.
<br><br>
In some states, auto transport companies may even be necessary to place an escort car alongside the <strong><a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/how-to-ship-a-truck" target="_blank">truck</a> </strong>to assist it in traversing the state. This could cause a slight delay.
<br><br>
<strong>Special regulations: </strong>Some states prohibit the operation of wide or oversized cargo overnight or on weekends.
<br><br>
<strong>Electronic logging devices (ELD)</strong> – Per the law, drivers must register their service hours using ELD. This is to guarantee that goods are transported safely.
<br><br>
When they reach a specific driving limit, they must rest for a particular time before hitting the roads again.

<h2><strong>Shipping Heavy Equipment After Preparation</strong></h2>
If you've chosen and are happy with a shipping company for your heavy equipment, take the following steps to make sure you're ready for pickup:
    <br><br>
<strong>Documents:</strong> You must ensure all permits and paperwork are in order before collection. You should confirm with the shipping company that the required visas are in place and have been obtained.
<br><br>
<strong>Check Condition and Take Pictures:</strong> Before you pick up your heavy equipment, you should check its condition and make sure it works.
<br><br>
It's a good idea to take high-quality photos with a time stamp, as this will give you great proof of the condition before any problems appear. Taking photos of any damage would also help.
<br><br>
<strong>Cover Critical Components:</strong> You should read the manual for your equipment and follow any instructions, such as turning off electrical components before transport.
<br><br>
Wrapping any of these 'vulnerable' components in bubble wrap or similar protective material is an excellent method to ensure the utmost security of your equipment.
