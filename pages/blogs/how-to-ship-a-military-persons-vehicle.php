Even so, many people may find the entire process to be perplexing, particularly when it comes to eligibility and the items that can be kept in the car.

                    <h2><span> Step. 1: Confirm Your Eligibility </span></h2>
                    <p>
                        To have your car sent as a service member, you must first be able to demonstrate that you match the standards. Keep in mind that only service members who have received orders for a permanent change of station, either to or from areas abroad, or who have had the homeport of their assigned vessel changed are permitted to ship a privately owned vehicle (POV). If you are officially one of the following, you are eligible here:
                        <br><br>
                        1): A Serving Member Of The U.S. Military
                        <br>
                        2): A Dod Civilian With The Necessary Instructions
                        <br>
                        3): Officially Retired

                    <p>
                        The U.S. Government will only cover one POV, which must be your own car or one you have rented for a dependent for only personal use. This vehicle needs to have wheels and be self-propelled. If it was altered to be a "lowrider" vehicle, it must also have at least six inches of clearance space from the ground. This reduces the possibility of damage occurring during loading, unloading, and removal from the carrier. Additionally, the lift kit shouldn't be taller than 3 inches.

                    <p>
                        The schedule for delivering military personnel's vehicles is often divided into two categories:
                        <br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span> (1) Army/Air Force members</span></b></em>
                        <br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span> (2) Navy/Marine Corps members.</span></b></em>
                        <br><br> If you're in the Army, you should be aware that, providing the assignment is for a year or more, your car will be available for shipping within a 90-day timeframe starting from the moment you embark for the tour overseas. It must be shipped within 30 days if the tour of service is shorter than a year.<br><br> If you are a member of the Navy, your vehicle is transportable if you have at least 12 months of service at the foreign duty station remaining, counting from the moment it was moved to the loading port. However, there are exceptions to this if you can demonstrate that the vehicle enables you to carry out your obligations in the Navy, which a superior officer would evaluate.

                        The following papers and documents must be ready for Military Car Shipping in order for it to go as smoothly and hassle-free as possible.
                        <br><br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span> Evidence of eligibility: </span></b></em>Your official military orders and revisions, one true copy 
                        <br><br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span> Evidence of identification: </span></b></em>One form of official identification, which must be shown when dropping off and picking up your vehicle (preferably, your passport).
                        <br><br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span>Evidence of ownership: </span></b></em>a clear copy of your title and registration, or your car's registration (the vehicle must be registered in the service member's name) (must be original certificates, not photocopies)
                        <br><br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span> Consignee Form: </span></b></em>This form is provided by the shipping business and asks for your name, address, and phone number as well as details about your automobile, its estimated value, and the person in charge of picking it up at the destination.
                        <br><br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span>Export Declaration by Shipper: </span></b></em>The U.S. The Census Bureau requires it whenever the total value of the delivered goods exceeds $2,500.
                        <br><br> <em style="font-style:normal;"><b><span>Specifying Dangerous Goods: </span></b></em>This declaration, which is required by several European nations, lists potentially hazardous items (e.g., the battery of your car)

                    <p>
                        It's vital to adhere to this and refrain from bending the rules in order to fit certain products in order to avoid shipment delays. In essence, the law states that you CAN NOT transport your vehicle with anything that is regarded to be either a household item or an item for outdoor activities like camping. Examples of these include televisions, DVD or Blu-ray players (unless factory sealed), liquids that can spill or leave stains, such as antifreeze, flammable liquids or lubricants, and any interior equipment that isn't permanently fixed in the car.

                        Keep checking your emails and texts since the shipping provider will keep you informed about the precise shipping date. And be prepared to turn in your car with the whole set of keys when the time comes. The ignition key, door and trunk keys, wheel lock, and gas cap key are all included in this.

                        The time has finally come. Make sure you have the following paperwork on hand before going to the VPC.
                        <br><br> Evidence of identification One form of official identification, which must be shown when dropping off and picking up your vehicle (preferably, your passport).
                        <br><br> Form of Inspection 
                        <br><br> Power of attorney or letter of authorisation 

                        notarized: You must do this if you won't be able to pick up your vehicle in person. You may authorize a friend or family member to act as your agent in this case.
                        <br><br> Make sure you have your bank information on hand before accepting electronic payment for this: your bank's name, ABA/SWIFT number, BIC/routing number, account name, and number. A customer service representative at the facility will ask you to sign in and give them all of the aforementioned paperwork. You and the representative can spot-check your car to check for any damage that might have occurred during shipping or transportation after everything has been confirmed. Even though it's highly rare, onsite claims staff are equipped with the essential tools to handle your claim right away.
