   <h1>Reliable Auto Transport</h1>
   Choosing a moving company can be difficult, but it is not the only service that requires investigation when relocating into a new home. If you've also decided to ship your vehicle, you must know which reliable auto transport companies offer the best services.
<h2><strong>5 Reliable Auto Transport Companies</strong></h2>
<h3><strong> AmeriFreight</strong></h3>
AmeriFreight works with the top 5% of more than 11,000 carriers to negotiate the best rate on behalf of the consignor and will not consider a carrier with a quality rating of less than 95 percent for its customers.
<br><br> 
The company offers a money-back guarantee and transports virtually all motorized items from coast to coast. With the AFta PLAN, your vehicle is fully covered by the carrier's insurance, which includes gap protection, so you need not fret about damages.
<br><br> 
AmeriFreight reports that transporting a sedan via open transport can range from approximately $500 to over $1,000. The positive aspect is that discounts are available for various groups, including <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/military-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>military</strong> </a>members, students, and seniors.
    <br><br> 
<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Pricing</li>
 	<li>Coast-to-coast distribution</li>
 	<li>Advisory services</li>
 	<li>Licensed</li>
 	<li>Insured</li>
 	<li>Gap insurance coverage provided</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Limited estimate tool capabilities</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> Rapid Auto Shipping</strong></h3>
Rapid Auto Shipping specializes in relocations, snowbird transfers, <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/multi-car-shipping" target="_blank"><strong>multi-vehicle transport</strong></a>, and the transport of late-model vehicles. They are also well-known for transporting classic cars, larger SUVs and pickups, and inoperable vehicles.
<br><br> 
However, this price can differ significantly based on the type of vehicle being shipped, the distance it must travel, the season, and other factors.
<br><br> 
If you ship with Rapid, you will be charged the initial fee once a carrier is secured. Before a carrier has been assigned, cancellation incurs a $25 dispatch fee.
<br><br> 
The company provides local and long-distance transport and door-to-door delivery. Direct delivery is Rapid's most popular mode of transportation because it offers shippers a significantly higher level of convenience.
<br><br> 
Rapid takes the additional step of reimbursing owners up to $20 for a car wash after shipping, recognizing that vehicles may become filthy during transport.
<br><br> 
<strong>Pros  </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Quote system</li>
 	<li>Convenient 24/7 vehicle tracking</li>
 	<li>Clean car guarantee</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong> Montway Auto Transport</strong></h3>
Unlike companies like uShip, Montway is an actual carrier. And, unlike the others, Montway only sends cars. When we used uShip to get a quote, Montway was one of the shippers that gave us a rate. Their price was in the middle of the pack, at about $1,300.
<br><br> 
We ran the exact shipping price for a 2003 Jeep Wrangler to and from the same place as we did for uShip. The price we got directly from Montway was much lower than the one we saw on uShip, which we found very interesting.
<br><br> 
<strong>Montway gives two prices:</strong> one for paying with cash and one for using a credit or debit card. The price on the credit card was $1,149. With a cost of $1,089, you saved $60 in cash. The price quote included insurance.
<br><br> 
<strong>Pros </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Price</li>
 	<li>Lower price for money</li>
 	<li>Insurance is free.</li>
 	<li>Straight shipper</li>
 	<li>Licensed</li>
 	<li>Insured</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Slightly more expensive than some others</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How Much Does Reliable Auto Transport Cost?</strong></h2>
The average cost of reliable auto transport varies from $800 to $2,500, but these prices can change. Each company sets shipping costs based on a variety of factors.
<h2><strong>Cost Factors For Reliable Auto Transport</strong></h2>
When figuring out how much it will cost to move your car, reliable auto transport companies look at some factors, including the ones below:
<br><br> 
<strong>Cost of fuel:</strong> When gas prices go up, shipping costs generally go up, too.
<br><br> 
<strong>Dangers on the road:</strong> Bad roads and bad weather can increase shipping costs.
<br><br> 
<strong>Type of vehicle:</strong> Larger or unique vehicles, like trucks and <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/rv-transport" target="_blank"><strong>RVs</strong></a>, generally cost more to ship.
<br><br> 
<strong>Time of year:</strong> Summer and January are busy transporting cars, so that prices will be higher around those times.
<br><br> 
<strong>Destination:</strong> While car shippers charge by the mile, rates usually decrease as the distance increases. So, a long-distance shipment from Florida to Las Vegas or Seattle will cost more but have a lower fee per mile. If you're moving abroad, you must pay extra for your shipment.
<br><br> 
<strong>Transport type:</strong> Open transport is less expensive than moving your car in an enclosed trailer. <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/blogs/terminal-to-terminal-auto-transport" target="_blank"><strong>Terminal to terminal shipping</strong></a> usually costs less than door to door shipping.
<br><br> 
<strong>Vehicle condition:</strong> Car movers usually charge more to move a car that can't be driven than one that can be conducted.
<h2><strong>How to Choose The Most Reliable Auto Transport Company?</strong></h2>
Choosing the best Reliable auto transport company for your needs starts with figuring out what factors are most important to you. If your car needs extra care, isn't driveable right now, is too big, or wants more choices, consider these things and choose a company that can meet your needs.
<br><br> 
The method works much better than just picking a random shipping company and trying to make them fit your needs.
<br><br> 
At first glance, car delivery companies can all look the same. Most of them can go almost anywhere you want, and most are good at getting your car there in perfect shape. Here are some things to remember when deciding which company is right for you.
<br><br> 
<strong>Budget</strong>
<br><br> 
Since so many companies move cars, looking around for one that can do the job at a fair price is essential. Many shippers offer lower prices if you don't need <a href="https://rapidautoshipping.com/services/door-to-door" target="_blank"><strong>door to door service</strong></a> or are okay with when they deliver your package.
    <br><br> 
<strong>Avoid Hidden Costs</strong>
<br><br> 
Ensure you know exactly what you're paying for before signing anything. Look for companies that stand behind the price they offer or tell you up front if there might be extra costs.
<br><br> 
Companies with iffy ethics often have hidden costs like delivery fees and additional fuel charges. Most of the time, there are better deals than the lowest price.
<br><br> 
<strong>Ratings of Customer Service</strong>
<br><br> 
Customer service is what transportation companies are really about. Almost everything you need to know about them can be found online.
<br><br> 
Their best assets are their ratings and reviews. Reading reviews and taking scores into account can help you save time and money and ensure you have a good time.
